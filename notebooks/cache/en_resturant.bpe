" jud@@ ging from previous post@@ s this used to be a good place , but not any longer . "
" we , there were four of us , arri@@ ved at noon - the place was emp@@ ty - and the staff ac@@ ted like we were im@@ pos@@ ing on them and they were very ru@@ de . "
" they never brought us compli@@ ment@@ ary nood@@ les , ignor@@ ed repe@@ ated re@@ quest@@ s for su@@ gar , and thre@@ w our dis@@ hes on the table . "
the food was lou@@ sy - too s@@ weet or too sal@@ ty and the por@@ tions tin@@ y .
" after all that , they compla@@ ined to me about the small tip . "
avoid this place !
" i have e@@ aten at sa@@ ul , many times , the food is always consist@@ ently , ou@@ trage@@ ously good . "
sa@@ ul is the best restau@@ rant on smith street and in bro@@ ok@@ ly@@ n .
the du@@ ck conf@@ it is always amaz@@ ing and the fo@@ ie gras terr@@ ine with fi@@ gs was out of this world .
the w@@ ine list is interesting and has many good values .
" for the price , you cannot eat this well in man@@ hat@@ tan . "
i was very dis@@ appointed with this restau@@ rant .
i@@ ve asked a car@@ t atten@@ dant for a lo@@ tus le@@ af w@@ rap@@ ped rice and she repli@@ ed back rice and just wal@@ ked away .
i had to ask her three times before she finally came back with the dis@@ h i@@ ve re@@ quest@@ ed .
" food was okay , nothing great . "
cho@@ w f@@ un was dry ; por@@ k sh@@ u mai was more than usu@@ ally gre@@ as@@ y and had to share a table with lou@@ d and ru@@ de family .
i / we will never go back to this place again .
" went on a 3 day oy@@ ster b@@ inge , with fish bring@@ ing up the clo@@ sing , and i am so glad this was the place it o tri@@ p en@@ ded , because it was so great ! "
" service was dev@@ ine , oy@@ sters where a sen@@ su@@ al as they come , and the price can 't be be@@ at ! ! ! "
you can 't go wrong here .
every time in new york i make it a point to visit restau@@ rant sa@@ ul on smith street .
" everything is always co@@ o@@ ked to perfec@@ tion , the service is excellent , the dec@@ or co@@ ol and under@@ stated . "
i had the du@@ ck bre@@ ast special on my last visit and it was incre@@ di@@ ble .
can 't wait wait for my next visit .
and i h@@ ate to say this but i doubt i 'll ever go back .
" the food is very aver@@ age ... the th@@ ai fu@@ sion stu@@ ff is a bit too s@@ weet , every thing they serve is too s@@ weet here . "
the only thing i moder@@ ately enjo@@ yed was their gri@@ l@@ led chi@@ cken special with ed@@ am@@ ame pu@@ re@@ e .
i had never had ed@@ am@@ ame pu@@ re@@ ed before but i thought it was innova@@ tive and ta@@ sty ( could 've used a bit more sal@@ t ) .
" the dec@@ or is night tho ... but they really need to clean that vent in the ce@@ iling ... its quite un@@ -@@ ap@@ peti@@ zing , and kil@@ ls your effort to make this place look sle@@ ek and modern . "
" their sake list was exten@@ sive , but we were looking for pur@@ ple ha@@ ze , which wasn 't li@@ sted but made for us upon request ! "
" the spi@@ cy tuna roll was un@@ usu@@ ally good and the rock sh@@ rim@@ p tem@@ pura was aw@@ es@@ ome , great ap@@ peti@@ zer to share ! "
we went around 9 : 30 on a fri@@ day and it had died down a bit by then so the service was great !
we love th p@@ ink pon@@ y .
the perfect spo@@ t .
fo@@ od@@ -@@ aw@@ es@@ ome .
servi@@ ce@@ - fri@@ end@@ ly and atten@@ tive .
ambi@@ an@@ ce@@ - rela@@ x@@ ed and sty@@ lis@@ h .
" don 't judge this place prima fa@@ cie , you have to try it to believe it , a home away from home for the liter@@ ate heart . "
the food is dec@@ ent .
" however , it 's the service that leav@@ es a bad taste in my mou@@ th . "
" i happen to have a policy that goes along with a little bit of self-@@ respect , which inclu@@ des not let@@ ting a wa@@ iter inti@@ mid@@ ate me , i.@@ e. make me feel bad asking for tri@@ vi@@ ali@@ ties like water , or the check . "
" i know , you were too bu@@ sy sho@@ wing off your vin@@ tage tee shi@@ rt and looking bor@@ ed , but my agenda is i 'm here to eat and enjo@@ y the company of friends , seek@@ ing a ple@@ as@@ ant experience . "
" well , i didn 't find it there , and trust , i have told everyone i can think of about my experience . "
the last time i wal@@ ked by it looked pretty emp@@ ty@@ . h@@ m@@ mm .
this place has got to be the best japan@@ ese restau@@ rant in the new york area .
i had a great experience .
food is great .
service is top not@@ ch .
i have been going back again and again .
" i tend to judge a su@@ shi restau@@ rant by its sea ur@@ ch@@ in , which was hea@@ ven@@ ly at su@@ shi rose . "
" it mel@@ ted in my little mou@@ th and the perfect consi@@ sten@@ cy@@ -@@ not too fis@@ hy , cre@@ amy , and sli@@ gh@@ tly but@@ ter@@ y . "
the su@@ shi se@@ em@@ ed pretty fre@@ sh and was ade@@ quat@@ ely proportion@@ ed .
the rice to fish ration was also good@@ --@@ they didn 't try to over@@ pack the rice .
we took advan@@ at@@ age of the half price su@@ shi deal on sat@@ ur@@ day so it was well worth it .
sur@@ pris@@ ingly nothing could be further from the truth .
" in the evening , this place attra@@ cted a well dre@@ ssed , with it , ny cro@@ wd . "
the food was well prepared and the service impe@@ cable .
i 'm going back .
quite simply it 's like step@@ ping out of man@@ hat@@ tan and into a haven of tran@@ quil@@ ity .
the prix fi@@ xe menu is worth every pen@@ ny and you get more than enough ( both in quanti@@ ty and quality ) .
i will be going back and he@@ arti@@ ly recom@@ mend it !
" it is terri@@ fic , as is the value . "
" $ 6 and there is much ta@@ sty food , all of it fre@@ sh and continu@@ ally re@@ fil@@ led . "
" i am not a veget@@ arian but , almost all the dis@@ hes were great . "
go hun@@ gry and enjo@@ y .
" the food here is rather good , but only if you like to wait for it . "
" i like the som@@ osas , ch@@ ai , and the ch@@ ole , but the d@@ ho@@ sas and d@@ hal were kin@@ da dis@@ sa@@ poin@@ ting . "
" the service var@@ ys from day to day@@ - sometimes they 're very nice , and sometimes not . "
" the kit@@ chen however , is almost always slo@@ w . "
" also , speci@@ fy if you like your food spi@@ cy@@ - its rather bland if you don 't . "
" the ambi@@ ence is pretty and nice for conver@@ sation , so a ca@@ su@@ al lun@@ ch here would probably be best . "
if you 've ever been along the river in we@@ e@@ haw@@ ken you have an idea of the top of view the char@@ t house has to offer .
add to that great service and great food at a reas@@ onable price and you have yourself the beginning of a great evening .
the la@@ va c@@ ake des@@ sert was incre@@ di@@ ble and i recom@@ mend it .
" once you step into co@@ sette , you 're mira@@ cul@@ ously in a small , off@@ -@@ the@@ -be@@ aten path par@@ isi@@ an bi@@ stro . "
" this tin@@ y restau@@ rant is as co@@ zy as it gets , with that certain par@@ isi@@ an fla@@ ir . "
" the food was aver@@ age to abo@@ ve-@@ aver@@ age ; the french oni@@ on sou@@ p fil@@ ling yet not over@@ ly impressi@@ ve , and the des@@ ser@@ ts not bri@@ lli@@ ant in any way . "
" however , go for the ambi@@ ence , and consider the food just a compan@@ ion for a tri@@ p across the world ! "
it was hor@@ ri@@ ble .
the pi@@ zza was deli@@ ver@@ ed col@@ d and the che@@ ese wasn 't even fully mel@@ ted !
it looked like sh@@ red@@ ded che@@ ese par@@ tly done - still in stri@@ ps .
this has got to be one of the most over@@ rat@@ ed restau@@ ran@@ ts in bro@@ ok@@ ly@@ n .
the pi@@ zza is over@@ pri@@ ced and so@@ g@@ gy .
" yes , they use fan@@ cy ingre@@ di@@ ents , but even fan@@ cy ingre@@ di@@ ents don 't make for good pi@@ zza unless someone knows how to get the cru@@ st right . "
" a big dis@@ appo@@ int@@ ment , all around . "
i think i 've had some the best me@@ als of my life at min@@ now .
" the se@@ af@@ o@@ od is amaz@@ ing , there 's a good w@@ ine list , and the ever@@ -@@ chang@@ ing menu always offer@@ s some great sur@@ prises . "
the combin@@ ation of super@@ -@@ fre@@ sh ingre@@ di@@ ents in the dis@@ hes are un@@ usu@@ al but really deli@@ ci@@ ous .
worth the tri@@ p from man@@ hat@@ tan .
best pa@@ str@@ ami i ever had and great por@@ tion without being ridi@@ cul@@ ous .
my wife had the fri@@ ed sh@@ rim@@ p which are huge and lo@@ ved it .
" as a japan@@ ese na@@ tive , i 've li@@ ved in the tri@@ state area for over 8 years , but i was just so amaz@@ ed at this place . "
this place is the most japan@@ ese it can ever get .
" the signs , the speci@@ als men@@ us , food , and even all the wa@@ it@@ staff are all tot@@ ally japan@@ ese . "
this place is worth an on@@ e-@@ hour drive .
" i am so coming back here again , as much as i can . "
" leon is an east village gem : ca@@ su@@ al but hip , with well prepared basic french bi@@ stro fare , good speci@@ als , a war@@ m and li@@ vely at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here . "
" my wife and i always enjo@@ y the young , not always well tra@@ ined but nevertheless fri@@ end@@ ly , staff , all of whom have a story . "
dec@@ ent w@@ ine at reas@@ onable prices .
have been doz@@ ens of times and never fai@@ led to enjo@@ y the experience .
" our teen@@ age ki@@ ds love it , too . "
" every@@ time i decide to try another place on the ues , i get an@@ gry that i didn 't just go to zu@@ c@@ cher@@ o pomo@@ dori . "
this is by far my favor@@ ite place in the neigh@@ bor@@ hood .
" the service is excellent , the dec@@ or is great , and the food is deli@@ ci@@ ous and comes in large por@@ tions . "
i 'm parti@@ al to the gno@@ c@@ chi .
this place is incre@@ di@@ bly tin@@ y .
they refu@@ se to se@@ at parties of 3 or more on week@@ ends .
the ho@@ st@@ ess is ru@@ de to the point of being offen@@ sive .
the food was bland o@@ ily .
i just don 't understand all the hy@@ pe ...
" we have been to this place many times , and always have great food , w@@ ine , and service . "
" we were wor@@ ried we would have trouble getting in , but some@@ how mana@@ ged to have a short wait . "
as always we had a great gla@@ ss of w@@ ine while we wa@@ it@@ ed .
" when we sat , we got great and fast service . "
the people that work there are always so fri@@ end@@ ly you forget you are in new york sometimes .
make sure you try this place as often as you can .
this is a f@@ un restau@@ rant to go to .
the pi@@ zza is y@@ um@@ my and i like the at@@ mo@@ sh@@ pere .
but the pi@@ zza is way to expen@@ sive .
" a large is $ 20 , and topp@@ ings are about $ 3 each . "
i went there for lun@@ ch and it was not as good as i expe@@ cted from the re@@ views i read .
sau@@ ce was wat@@ ery and the food didn 't have much fla@@ vor .
i don 't think i would go again .
this place is great .
i had a huge group for my bir@@ th@@ day and we were well taken care of .
the wa@@ it@@ re@@ ss was very patient with us and the food is p@@ hen@@ omen@@ al !
" service was pro@@ mp@@ t , fri@@ end@@ ly and great . "
sli@@ gh@@ tly on the pri@@ ce@@ y side but worth it !
great pi@@ zza and fanta@@ stic service .
" there was a small wait , but shor@@ ter than i expe@@ cted . "
lo@@ cated at the end of a mag@@ ni@@ fic@@ ent blo@@ ck .
very co@@ zy and war@@ m in@@ side .@@ ....
i will be back !
this is the best su@@ shi in new york city - hands down .
the place is small and c@@ ram@@ ped but the food is fanta@@ stic .
get the tuna of gari .
" planet th@@ ail@@ and has always been a hit with me , i go there usu@@ ally for the su@@ shi , which is great , the th@@ ai food is excellent too . "
" with the great vari@@ ety on the menu , i eat here often and never get bor@@ ed . "
" the at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here isn 't the great@@ est , but i suppose that 's how they keep the prices down . "
it 's all about the food ! !
first it took us a long time to find the place .
" but when we looked at the menu , there wer@@ en 't a lot of cho@@ i@@ ces , most of them were dum@@ pl@@ ings in the ap@@ peti@@ zer se@@ ction . "
" those ro@@ lls were big , but not good and sa@@ sh@@ imi wasn 't fre@@ sh . "
" they were dry and dis@@ gu@@ sting , i didn 't even fin@@ ish my first pie@@ ce . "
hur@@ ley 's is like che@@ ers where everyone knows your name and they are actually glad you came .
" try the c@@ run@@ chy tuna , it is to die for . "
" try everything for that matter , it is all good . "
i have been going there since it open@@ ed and i can 't get enough .
first went here to enjo@@ y their garden ter@@ race .
" the food was amaz@@ ing , and the service was pro@@ mp@@ t and hel@@ p@@ ful , but not over@@ -be@@ aring or rus@@ hed . "
" the ste@@ ak tar@@ tare is a great bet , they fi@@ x it for you at the table . "
" ad@@ mit@@ te@@ dly some ni@@ ghts in@@ side the restau@@ rant were rather war@@ m , but the open kit@@ chen is part of the char@@ m . "
" great w@@ ine selec@@ tion , gi@@ gon@@ das is worth the price , and the house cham@@ pagne is a great value . "
" it may be a bit pac@@ ked on week@@ ends , but the vi@@ be is good and it is the best french food you will find in the area . "
" have recom@@ men@@ ded the place to friends , always gets good response . "
" pi@@ zza - the only pi@@ zza in ny@@ c that should not have additional topp@@ ings - the cru@@ st ta@@ stes like the best , fre@@ sh@@ ly bak@@ ed bre@@ ad ! "
i take all my ny@@ c gu@@ est@@ s to vt 's .
" not sure where the previous re@@ vie@@ wer , lon@@ k , din@@ ed , but sa@@ ul is in a great neigh@@ bor@@ hood and has great food ! "
i 've been there three times and have always had wonder@@ ful experi@@ ences .
i 'd high@@ ly recom@@ mend it for a special occasion -- it provides and in@@ tim@@ ate set@@ ting and nice service .
i 'm not sure where the other re@@ vie@@ wers ate but it seems as if we visi@@ ted two different restau@@ ran@@ ts because my friends and i all enjo@@ y mi@@ zu very much ... and we 're repe@@ at cu@@ stom@@ ers .
even after they over@@ char@@ ged me the last time i was there .
make sure you have the spi@@ cy sc@@ allo@@ p roll .. .
it 's deli@@ ci@@ ous !
" mou@@ les were excellent , lob@@ ster ra@@ vi@@ oli was very sal@@ ty ! "
" took my mom for mother 's day , and the mait@@ re d ' was pretty ru@@ de . "
" told us to sit any@@ where , and when we sat he said the table was reser@@ ved . "
step@@ ped on my fo@@ ot on the second time he reached over me to ad@@ just ligh@@ ting .
tin@@ y des@@ sert was $ 8@@ .00 ... just pla@@ in over@@ pri@@ ced for what it is .
the drin@@ ks are always well@@ l made and w@@ ine selec@@ tion is fair@@ ly pri@@ ced .
try their chef 's speci@@ al@@ s-@@ - they are to die for .
" service is not exactly five star , but th@@ ats not really a big deal . "
dow@@ n@@ sta@@ irs lo@@ unge is always a good attra@@ ction
" ra@@ ga 's is a roman@@ tic , co@@ zy restau@@ rant . "
the ex@@ oti@@ c food is beau@@ ti@@ fully presented and is a deli@@ ght in deli@@ ci@@ ous combin@@ ations .
it is also extremely well pri@@ ced .
the staff is incre@@ di@@ bly hel@@ p@@ ful and atten@@ tive .
the bar is very well sto@@ cked with interesting be@@ ers and well pri@@ ced win@@ es .
this is one of my favor@@ ite restau@@ ran@@ ts and it is not to be mis@@ sed .
your friends will thank you for introdu@@ cing them to this gem !
" when we stum@@ bled on leon , we thought that we had found quite the gem but , we were certainly wrong . "
" the wa@@ it@@ re@@ ss mo@@ ved our table practi@@ cally into the bat@@ h@@ room and when we asked to can@@ cel our din@@ ner or@@ ders because we did not want to eat sitting on the to@@ il@@ et , we were told no ... "
" then , to top things off , she d@@ rop@@ ped used sil@@ ver@@ ware on my boy@@ friend 's jac@@ ket and did not stop to apo@@ logi@@ ze or clean the mes@@ s that was left on clo@@ thes . "
such a dis@@ appo@@ int@@ ment ...
" ru@@ de service , medi@@ core food ... there are tons of restau@@ ran@@ ts in ny ... stay away from this one "
i had a gra@@ t time at je@@ ky@@ ll and hy@@ de !
i lo@@ ved every@@ th@@ ig about it-@@ especially the shows and ac@@ tors .
our ser@@ ver was very hel@@ p@@ ful and fri@@ end@@ ly .
i am bring@@ ing my whole family back next time .
the food was good too .
the tuna and wa@@ sabe po@@ tat@@ o@@ es are excellent .
the out@@ door at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here of sitting on the si@@ de@@ walk wat@@ ching the world go by 50 fe@@ et away on 6@@ th a@@ venue on a co@@ ol evening was wonder@@ ful .
" in@@ side is a little c@@ ram@@ ped , but to be expe@@ cted . "
service was pro@@ mp@@ t and cour@@ te@@ ous .
this was a repe@@ at visit and we 'll defin@@ it@@ ely be back again .
" great service , great food . "
prices are in line .
but too far east !
" the pi@@ zza is deli@@ ci@@ ous - they use fre@@ sh moz@@ zar@@ ella instead of the che@@ ap , fro@@ zen , sh@@ red@@ ded che@@ ese common to most pi@@ z@@ zar@@ ia 's . "
" two compla@@ in@@ ts@@ - their ap@@ peti@@ zer selec@@ tion stin@@ ks , it would be nice to get some moz@@ zar@@ ella sti@@ cks on the menu . "
" also , because it is so th@@ in , it gets col@@ d very quickly and its not that fil@@ ling . "
wait staff is blan@@ tent@@ ly un@@ appreci@@ ative of your business but its the best pie on the u@@ ws !
by far the best sala@@ d i have had in a fast food restau@@ rant .
fine din@@ ing restau@@ rant quality .
over 100 different cho@@ i@@ ces to create your own .
a must try !
" on a recent sun@@ day after@@ noon , a friend and i ac@@ cident@@ ly found this great restau@@ rant on our way to see the pu@@ lit@@ zer pri@@ ze win@@ ning play doubt . "
" this was the perfect qui@@ et , rela@@ x@@ ing , and deli@@ ci@@ ous ac@@ compan@@ iment to our after@@ noon of the@@ ater . "
" the chi@@ cken pot pie is ex@@ c@@ pe@@ tion@@ a , the che@@ es@@ e@@ burger huge and deli@@ c@@ table , and the service profession@@ al wan war@@ m . "
" with so many poor experi@@ ences to be had in the the@@ ater distri@@ ct , is truly an excellent find ! "
we will return many times for this oa@@ sis in mid@@ -@@ town .
the staff is no non@@ sense .
the food op@@ tions rule .
when i li@@ ved up@@ state for a while i would buy fre@@ eze the ba@@ gel@@ s and they would still be better than any else .
worth visit@@ ing the 1@@ st ave spo@@ t because it is the original store .
" he ser@@ ved me an uni hand roll , which i never had before , and let me tell you ... it was heaven ! "
the sake menu should not be over@@ looked !
" all in all , this mid@@ town gem instan@@ tly became one of my favor@@ ite su@@ shi restau@@ ran@@ ts in the city . "
try the lob@@ ster teri@@ yak@@ i and the rose special roll .
" service was very good - pro@@ mp@@ t , atten@@ tive and non-@@ in@@ tru@@ sive . "
" food was very good as well , consider@@ ing that we tried the budget selec@@ tion ( though i wish the por@@ k bell@@ y that i or@@ dered was ro@@ ast@@ ed a bit longer , so that fat was more of a mel@@ t-@@ in-@@ your@@ -@@ mou@@ th experience ) . "
w@@ ine list selec@@ tion is good and win@@ e-@@ by@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ gla@@ ss was gener@@ ously fil@@ led to the top .
tradi@@ tional french dec@@ our was ple@@ as@@ ant though the hall was rather no@@ is@@ y - the restau@@ rant was full and we had to raise our voices to be able to main@@ tain a conver@@ sation .
" i 've been to at ca@@ fe spi@@ ce probably 5-@@ 8 times , it is probably still the best indi@@ an restau@@ rant around union squ@@ are . "
" to sum it up : service var@@ ies from good to medi@@ or@@ ce , depen@@ ding on which wa@@ iter you get ; gener@@ ally it is just aver@@ age ok . "
" se@@ ating is always pro@@ mp@@ t , though the restau@@ rant does fil@@ l up in the evening . "
" food is usu@@ ally very good , though oca@@ sion@@ ally i wonder@@ ed about fre@@ sh@@ mes@@ s of ra@@ w ve@@ gat@@ ables in side or@@ ders . "
" as many other re@@ vie@@ wers noti@@ ced , your order is often slo@@ w to arrive - this is particularly true in the evening but is not a problem during lun@@ ch time . "
" the dec@@ or is vi@@ bran@@ t and ey@@ e-@@ ple@@ as@@ ing with several sem@@ i-@@ private bo@@ ths on the right side of the din@@ ing hall , which are great for a date . "
i have never been dis@@ appointed in the red eye .
" the first time i went , and was completely taken by the live jaz@@ z band and at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here , i or@@ dered the lob@@ ster co@@ bb sala@@ d . "
it 's simply the best me@@ al in ny@@ c .
you cannot go wrong at the red eye gri@@ ll .
" if we were to move from the up@@ per east side , we would genu@@ in@@ ely miss this restau@@ rant . "
the restau@@ rant is cu@@ te but not up@@ sc@@ ale .
the food is a diam@@ ond in rou@@ gh -- the food is deli@@ ci@@ ous and hom@@ em@@ ade with the perfect balance of her@@ bs and tom@@ ato@@ es .
i would high@@ ly recom@@ mend it .
it 's one of our favor@@ ite places to eat in ny .
we had a great time at the je@@ ky@@ ll and hy@@ de pu@@ b last night .
after really enjo@@ ying ourselves at the bar we sat down at a table and had din@@ ner .
the ser@@ ver was really co@@ ol and ser@@ ved us our food and drin@@ ks with a smi@@ le .
the place 's dec@@ or and hid@@ den bat@@ h@@ ro@@ oms made for a good lau@@ gh .
i high@@ ly recom@@ mend visit@@ ing this restau@@ rant and having din@@ ner and drin@@ ks !
" if you are the type of person who lik@@ es being scar@@ ed and enter@@ ta@@ ined , this is a great place to go and eat . "
" my husband and i thou@@ gt it would be great to go to the je@@ ky@@ ll and hy@@ de pu@@ b for our anniver@@ sary , and to our sur@@ prise it was fanta@@ stic . "
" the have over 100 different be@@ ers to offer thi@@ er gu@@ est so that made my husband very happy and the food was deli@@ ci@@ ous , if i must recom@@ mend a dis@@ h it must be the pu@@ m@@ kin tor@@ tel@@ ini . "
the enter@@ ta@@ in@@ ment was great they have shows that go on through out the din@@ ner .
" please take my ad@@ vice , go and try this place . "
you will not be dis@@ apo@@ in@@ ted at all .
we were not dis@@ sap@@ pointed in the least bit by this little gem .
the ba@@ gel was huge .
they were ser@@ ved war@@ m and had a so@@ ft flu@@ ff@@ y interior .
the workers there also absolutely lo@@ ad the ba@@ gel with cre@@ am che@@ ese ( gets a little mes@@ sy ) .
i lo@@ ved it and would high@@ ly recom@@ mend .
this was my frist time at ca@@ fe st@@ . bart 's and i must say how deli@@ c@@ ous the food and the service was .
i have to high@@ ly recom@@ mend the lob@@ ster roll - not to much ma@@ yo ; you can tell it was a fre@@ sh lob@@ ster .
" other gu@@ est@@ s enjo@@ yed pi@@ zza , santa fe chop@@ ped sala@@ d and fish and chi@@ ps . "
" i high@@ ly recom@@ mend ca@@ fe st@@ . bart 's for their food , the ambi@@ ence and wonder@@ ful service . "
all the staff is absolutely profession@@ al ! !
but they do .
" ( that is a must , but not every restau@@ rant can do ... ) "
" there 's nice and qui@@ et , small but enough for 6 ( or more ) . "
this restau@@ rant was way over@@ hy@@ ped .
my cho@@ w f@@ un and cho@@ w see was really bland and o@@ ily .
oka@@ y@@ -i don 't mind the o@@ ily part ( cause most are co@@ o@@ ked that way ) but it was way too bland .
the sc@@ alli@@ on pan@@ c@@ akes and fri@@ ed dum@@ pl@@ ings were nothing out of the ordin@@ ary .
the service was the only thing good about this restau@@ rant .
" it 's bor@@ ing on the in@@ side , and our su@@ shi was pretty belo@@ w aver@@ age ... the tuna was so@@ g@@ gy and the other ro@@ lls had no fla@@ vor . "
i defin@@ it@@ ely wouldn 't go back .
their pad pen@@ ang is deli@@ ci@@ ous and everything else is fanta@@ stic .
the price is reas@@ onable although the service is poor .
fre@@ sh restau@@ rant was amaz@@ ing ..@@ ..@@ .... food was deli@@ ci@@ ous and of course fre@@ sh .
" great for a roman@@ tic evening , or a f@@ un evening with friends ... "
i will be going back very soon .
keep up the good work .
hat@@ s off to the chef .
it was wonder@@ ful .
" the sal@@ ads are deli@@ ci@@ ous , both re@@ fre@@ sh@@ ing and very spi@@ cy . "
we had pa@@ m 's special fri@@ ed fish and it was amaz@@ ing .
too large for just two people but nothing was left .
" great vi@@ be , lo@@ ts of people . "
" my hus@@ band@@ s was perfect , my was well done and dry . "
" i didn 't compla@@ in , i li@@ ked the at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here so much . "
on a hot day it was fa@@ bul@@ ous to stop in and enjo@@ y lun@@ ch .
" ambi@@ ence is so cu@@ te and qu@@ ain@@ t , good for business although we were there on va@@ cation . "
sal@@ ads were fanta@@ stic .
although we were looking for regular let@@ tu@@ ce and some wal@@ nu@@ ts the sal@@ ads we got were great .
ingre@@ di@@ ents are organ@@ ic which is a real plus for me .
we will be back .
" this is some really good , in@@ expen@@ sive su@@ shi . "
the spi@@ cy tuna roll is huge and probably the best that i 've had at this price ran@@ ge .
the yel@@ lo@@ w@@ ta@@ il was particularly good as well .
" i have reserva@@ tions about the all you can eat deal , however -- the cho@@ i@@ ces are fair@@ ly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than $ 18 by just going off the menu . "
" in any event , this is a place i 'll be sure to stop by again when i 'm in this part of town . "
big w@@ ong gets big up@@ s for a fine establis@@ h@@ ment .
" they have it all -- great price , food , and service . "
the at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here is no@@ is@@ y and the wa@@ it@@ ers are liter@@ ally wal@@ king around doing things as fast as they can .
the food is prepared quickly and effici@@ ently .
" and it all comes at a very reas@@ onable price ( con@@ ge@@ e , nood@@ les , and rice dis@@ hes are no more than $ 3-@@ 6 each ) . "
the ta@@ ke@@ out is great too since they give high quality tu@@ p@@ per@@ ware as well .
this place is always very crow@@ ded and popular .
enjo@@ yed a very nice ca@@ esar sala@@ d while my wife had ar@@ ugu@@ la and go@@ at che@@ ese .... both very ta@@ sty .
we both op@@ ted for a pa@@ sta dis@@ h and they were ser@@ ved ti@@ mely and fre@@ sh .
" we conclu@@ ded with ti@@ ram@@ isu cho@@ col@@ ate c@@ ake , both were deli@@ ci@@ ous . "
we 'd go back again
i recently went to this restau@@ rant with some co-@@ workers for lun@@ ch and had an amaz@@ ing time .
" the staff was ac@@ com@@ od@@ ating , the food was absolutely deli@@ ci@@ ous and the place is lo@@ vely . "
we even had a visit from the manag@@ er who wanted to make sure we were enjo@@ ying ourselves .
" yes , the prices are high , but i felt it was worth it . "
we all felt it was worth it .
sometimes i get good food and ok service .
" sometimes i get bad food and bad service , sometimes i get good good and bad service . "
it is not consist@@ ent .
the place is a bi@@ stro which means : simple dis@@ hes and w@@ ine ser@@ ved effici@@ ently in a bu@@ st@@ ling at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here .
and where does pa@@ tis go wrong ; no where .
" you are not e@@ ating haut cu@@ is@@ ine with sub@@ tle hin@@ ts of whatever but : cas@@ su@@ olet , ste@@ ake fr@@ itte , tri@@ pe ste@@ w , etc ; simple stu@@ ff . "
and evalu@@ ated on those terms pa@@ stis is simply wonder@@ ful .
right off the l in bro@@ ok@@ ly@@ n this is a nice co@@ zy place with good pi@@ zza .
mine was a little bur@@ nt but still deli@@ ci@@ ous with go@@ at che@@ ese and pan@@ ch@@ etta ( rad@@ di@@ chio was kind of bit@@ ter though ) .
my friend got the mu@@ sh@@ room pi@@ zza which ta@@ sted better .
the sang@@ ria was pretty ta@@ sty and good on a hot mu@@ g@@ gy day .
kind of a small place but i guess if they are not too bu@@ sy might be able to fit a group or ki@@ ds .
over@@ all i would recom@@ mend it and go back again .
i started out with a bom@@ bay be@@ er which was big enough for two .
m@@ m@@ m@@ mm ... it was deli@@ ci@@ ous .
" service was slo@@ w , but the people were fri@@ end@@ ly . "
it 's a nice place to rela@@ x and have conver@@ sation .
i can 't wait to go back .
the food is auth@@ enti@@ c italian - deli@@ ci@@ ous !
" pi@@ zza is terri@@ fic , as is hom@@ em@@ ade pa@@ sta . "
" ambi@@ ence is deli@@ gh@@ t@@ ful , service impe@@ cc@@ able . "
i 'm still mad that i had to pay for lou@@ sy food .
the han@@ ger ste@@ ak was like rub@@ ber and the tuna was f@@ lavor@@ less not to mention it ta@@ sted like it had just been th@@ aw@@ ed .
service was also hor@@ ri@@ ble and the ambi@@ ence is not that great .
do not try unless you 're just going there to hang out like the rest of the hi@@ p@@ sters who appar@@ ently have no sense of taste .
i go and eat out at many different restau@@ ran@@ ts and this is one place you have go and try .
this is my first time writing a review for a restau@@ rant because the food and service was excellent .
the fil@@ et mi@@ g@@ non dis@@ h was super@@ b !
i would defi@@ ant@@ ly come back here again as one of my top cho@@ i@@ ces .
it 's a small cu@@ te restau@@ rant .
i absolutely love this place ! ! !
" i like the ambi@@ ence , it 's very dar@@ k and original . "
the su@@ shi is amaz@@ ing ! ! !
and amaz@@ ingly che@@ ap .
big thum@@ bs up !
very af@@ for@@ dable and excellent ambi@@ ent !
we or@@ dered some be@@ ef and nood@@ le sou@@ p dis@@ hes from the th@@ ai se@@ ction of the menu but nothing we got was th@@ ai .
we were very dis@@ appointed .
we won 't go to this place again for a good me@@ al .
" however , i think this place is a good hang out spo@@ t . "
my gir@@ l@@ friend and i stum@@ bled on@@ to this ho@@ pping place the other night and had a great time !
the pi@@ zza and w@@ ine were excell@@ ent@@ -@@ the service to@@ o-@@ -@@ but what really made this place was the bac@@ ky@@ ard din@@ ing area .
it is one the nic@@ est out@@ door restau@@ ran@@ ts i have ever seen in ny@@ -@@ -i am from it@@ aly and this place ri@@ val@@ s the ones in my country .
" they tell me they are going to cover the garden in gla@@ ss for the win@@ ter , so i 'm looking forward to going there on a sno@@ wy night to enjo@@ y it . "
check this place out !
high@@ ly recom@@ men@@ ded ! ! ! ! !
" first of all , this place is * not * roman@@ tic , as cla@@ i@@ med by cit@@ y@@ search 's ed@@ itori@@ al review . "
" either that , or the ed@@ itor 's idea of roman@@ ce must be shar@@ ing a conver@@ sation with the next table , while trying to speak lou@@ der than the traf@@ fic on 5@@ 7@@ th . "
" the ta@@ bles are c@@ ram@@ med way too close , the menu is ty@@ pi@@ cal of any italian restau@@ rant , and the w@@ ine list is simply over@@ pri@@ ced . "
sli@@ gh@@ tly above aver@@ age win@@ es start at $ 70 + with only one selec@@ tion li@@ sted at $ 30 + .
service is not what one would expect from a joint in this price categ@@ ory .
" for in@@ stance , plat@@ es were just dum@@ ped on the table , i was han@@ ded the w@@ ine list up@@ side down , etc .... "
some@@ how working the italian char@@ m with constan@@ t mille grazie does not constitu@@ te proper service .
" to be completely fair , the only rede@@ em@@ ing factor was the food , which was above aver@@ age , but couldn 't make up for all the other defici@@ en@@ cies of te@@ od@@ ora . "
not one of our me@@ als was edi@@ ble - bland and / or made with wei@@ r@@ d ro@@ sem@@ ary or or@@ ange f@@ lavor@@ ing .
fish was over@@ done .
" cu@@ te place , nice wait staff but would never go there again . "
someone else recom@@ men@@ ded the des@@ sert - we also left that .
one of us actually li@@ ked the expres@@ so - that 's it .
" ski@@ p this restau@@ rant , it 's a big dis@@ appo@@ int@@ ment . "
my@@ agi is one of my favor@@ ite restau@@ ran@@ ts in the city ; the place the negative re@@ views descri@@ be sound like they were some@@ where else .
i 've never had bad service and the fish is fre@@ sh and deli@@ ci@@ ous .
their tuna tar@@ tar ap@@ peti@@ zer is to die for .
" i come from a family of pi@@ z@@ zer@@ ia ow@@ ners , and i 'm almost as@@ ham@@ ed to say that the pi@@ zza in for@@ n@@ ino 's blo@@ ws my families recei@@ pi@@ es away . "
it is simply amaz@@ ing .
the place is so co@@ ol and the service is pro@@ mp@@ t and cur@@ ti@@ ous .
i high@@ ly recom@@ mend to anyone to give this place a try .
you will find yourself re@@ turning quite often .
a restau@@ rant that doesn 't try to do anything except serve great food with great service in a ple@@ as@@ ant at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here .
no gi@@ m@@ mi@@ cks here -- the food spe@@ aks for itself in its fre@@ sh@@ ness and prepar@@ ation .
the din@@ ing room is qui@@ et@@ ly eleg@@ ant with no music to sh@@ out over -- how re@@ fre@@ sh@@ ing !
" the service was impe@@ cc@@ able and un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive -- the staff knows what they are there to do -- to know their menu , present your me@@ al , and attend to your needs . "
" looking around , i saw a room full of new yor@@ kers enjo@@ ying a real me@@ al in a real restau@@ rant , not a clu@@ b@@ house of the fa@@ bul@@ ous trying to be seen . "
beautiful experience .
the view is bre@@ ath@@ taking the service is top not@@ ch ... the ambi@@ ance is wonder@@ full .
the staff offer@@ s impe@@ cc@@ able service .
i had lob@@ ster bis@@ que it has 2 oz@@ . of maine lob@@ ster in it .
my boy@@ friend had the new england cho@@ w@@ der it was good but i think the a@@ ward should go to the lob@@ ster bis@@ que .
it was div@@ ine mel@@ ts in your mou@@ th .
my boy@@ friend had prime ri@@ b it was good .
we didn 't want a bo@@ tt@@ le of bu@@ bb@@ ly on a week@@ day so we each got little bo@@ tt@@ les of kor@@ bett it was just enough .
it 's cu@@ z it 's so good you need to taste it ! ! !
all in all we 're already coming up with excu@@ ses to go ahead really soon in the next few w@@ ks ! ! ! !
my wife and i ate here earlier this week and have not stop@@ ped ran@@ ting and ra@@ ving about the food .
if you like spi@@ cy food get the chi@@ cken vin@@ dal@@ oo .
it 's very spi@@ cy but not offen@@ sive .
we will defin@@ it@@ ely go back .
go to vol@@ are for 1@@ st cla@@ ss service and terri@@ fic food .
the por@@ tions are large and the ser@@ vers always sur@@ prise us with a different star@@ ter .
the w@@ ine list is excellent .
the food is amaz@@ ing ... especially if you get the chef 's ta@@ sting menu and your fa@@ vou@@ rite bo@@ tt@@ le ( or two ! ) of w@@ ine from an exten@@ sive selec@@ tion of win@@ es .
" the place is small and in@@ tim@@ ate and you may feel a little crow@@ ded , but the service is excellent and it 's great for friends out , a roman@@ tic date , or a special oc@@ cas@@ sion . "
the food can get pri@@ ce@@ y but the pri@@ xe fi@@ xe ta@@ sting menu is the great@@ est food for a good price and they cat@@ er the food to any food aller@@ gies or food you don 't like .
please be aware that it 's cas@@ h or am@@ ex only !
" with the excep@@ tion of our lem@@ on sala@@ d that had so much pe@@ pper on it that our eyes started wat@@ ering , the food here was dec@@ ent , not great . "
the menu is very limited - i think we coun@@ ted 4 or 5 entre@@ es .
" we or@@ dered the special , gri@@ l@@ led bran@@ z@@ ino , that was so in@@ fu@@ sed with bone , it was difficult to eat . "
" the dec@@ or in this place is very din@@ er@@ -@@ ish and the kind of place you expect in the east village - not roman@@ tic , just simple , small and spar@@ se . "
problem is nothing at pr@@ une is particularly memor@@ able .
no plans to return any@@ time soon .
this place is so much f@@ un .
our family never expe@@ cted such incre@@ di@@ ble enter@@ ta@@ in@@ ment in a restau@@ rant .
our food was great too !
and really large por@@ tions .
the staff was the fri@@ end@@ li@@ est that have seen in new york .
we will go back every time we are in the city .
if you want something really different than try je@@ ky@@ ll and hy@@ de .
it is a lot of f@@ un with live enter@@ ta@@ in@@ ment and all kin@@ ds of dis@@ ney type special effects .
the food was pretty tradi@@ on@@ al but it was hot and good with large por@@ tions .
i high@@ ly recom@@ mend it .
the place is a lot of f@@ un .
my six year old lo@@ ved it .
the char@@ ac@@ ters really make for an enjo@@ y@@ able experience .
" the food however , is what one might expect . "
it is very over@@ pri@@ ced and not very ta@@ sty .
" however , i think je@@ ck@@ ll and hy@@ des t is one of those places that is f@@ un to do once . "
we had a good time .
went there with my wife and we had to wait for a table even though you could see there many that were emp@@ ty with not reserva@@ tion sig@@ h on them .
service was slo@@ w had to wait to order and get food although not crow@@ ded .
drin@@ ks way over pri@@ ced .
food was good not great not worth the wait or another visit
great pi@@ zza for lun@@ ch place .
service was qui@@ ck .
the pi@@ zza was great .
and it was qui@@ ck which is very important .
have the i@@ ced tea .
it was wonder@@ ful .
" wh@@ en@@ ever you need a su@@ shi fi@@ x , mi@@ zu will be there with quality fish and great service . "
deli@@ very is fast too .
" great fri@@ end@@ ly service , fast se@@ ating , fast deli@@ very , excellent su@@ shi . "
a little over@@ pri@@ ced but worth it once you take a b@@ ite .
es@@ s-@@ a-@@ ba@@ gel ( either by sty@@ -@@ town or mid@@ town ) is by far the best ba@@ gel in ny .
" the ba@@ gel@@ s always war@@ m , so@@ ft on the in@@ side , cris@@ p@@ y on the outside and enor@@ mous in size . "
they have a huge selec@@ tion of different cre@@ am che@@ eses and all of their sal@@ ads are great .
the lo@@ x is always fre@@ sh too .
high@@ ly recom@@ men@@ ded to all !
not im@@ pres@@ sed with the food .
prices too high for this c@@ ram@@ ped and un@@ appe@@ aling rest@@ ur@@ ant .
zero ambi@@ ance to bo@@ ot .
i thought this place was tot@@ ally over@@ rat@@ ed .
everything we had was good or ok .... but defin@@ it@@ ely nothing great .
" the ambi@@ ence was nice , but service wasn 't so great . "
" when you add it all together , it just doesn 't seem worth it to me ... especially consider@@ ing the prices . "
this is the best sha@@ bu@@ -@@ sha@@ bu restau@@ rant in the try@@ -@@ state area .
i have li@@ ved in japan for 7 years and the taste of the food and the feel of the restau@@ rant is like being back in japan .
thi@@ us is a must for anyone who lo@@ ves sha@@ bu@@ -@@ sha@@ bu .
" the at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here is nothing special , but it fe@@ els like a su@@ shi establis@@ h@@ ment in toky@@ o . "
the ow@@ ner and staff are all japan@@ ese as well and that ad@@ ds to the entire ambi@@ ance .
" despite a sli@@ gh@@ tly limited menu , everything prepared is done to perfec@@ tion , ul@@ tra fre@@ sh and a work of food art . "
i must give it y@@ on out of y@@ on star@@ s !
tax@@ an deli@@ ci@@ ous !
" this restau@@ rant was recom@@ men@@ ded by a local ... as a matter of fact , he made the reserva@@ tion for us and said we would not be dis@@ appointed ! "
the prices were che@@ ap compar@@ ed to the quality of service and food .
" we li@@ ked it so much , that we will always make it a point to dine here when we visit new york . "
the lo@@ cation and ambi@@ ence is ok but the food is what makes up for it .
there is a lot of vari@@ ety even for people who eat veget@@ arian like me .
try green cur@@ ry with veget@@ ables .
" the quanti@@ ty is also very good , you will come out satis@@ fied . "
" the service is ok , some of the people didn 't get what they asked for . "
i was there on sat@@ . for my bir@@ th@@ day and we had an excellent time .
i had the best ra@@ vi@@ oli ever .
the w@@ ine the service was very good too .
moder@@ ate prices .
a little no@@ ise but i think that was because of our party !
this qu@@ ain@@ t and roman@@ tic trat@@ toria is at the top of my man@@ hat@@ tan restau@@ rant list .
" the food is deli@@ ci@@ ous - from the speci@@ als to the regular menu@@ -@@ fare , the dis@@ hes are never a dis@@ appo@@ int@@ ment . "
" whether it 's the par@@ mes@@ ean por@@ c@@ ini sou@@ ff@@ le or the lam@@ b gla@@ zed with bal@@ sam@@ ic vin@@ egar , you will surely be transpor@@ ted to nor@@ thern it@@ aly with one b@@ ite . "
" although the ta@@ bles may be clo@@ sely situ@@ ated , the c@@ and@@ le-@@ light , fo@@ od@@ -@@ quality and service over@@ compen@@ sate . "
a guarante@@ eed deli@@ ght !
" i have known about this secret for the last 13 years , emi@@ lio ( the god@@ father ) has continu@@ ed to serve food and w@@ ine for the gods at mor@@ tal prices . "
" if you go , try the marin@@ ara / arra@@ bi@@ atta sau@@ ce , the moz@@ zar@@ ella en car@@ oz@@ za is m@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ mm .@@ .... everything is just deli@@ ci@@ ous . "
check out the secret back room .
i pra@@ y it sta@@ ys open for@@ ever .
thank you emi@@ lio .
" i found the food , service and value excep@@ tional every@@ time i have been there . "
the food was auth@@ enti@@ c .
i felt as though i were e@@ ating in paris .
the service was excellent - fri@@ end@@ ly and atten@@ tive .
the prices are wonder@@ fully low .
very good w@@ ine cho@@ i@@ ces .
who has room for che@@ es@@ esti@@ cks with the best pi@@ zza in ny@@ c !
get the pe@@ p@@ per@@ oni - y@@ um - and a family sty@@ le sala@@ d .
great staff .
always great service !
i go twi@@ ce a month !
fanta@@ stic !
" the food is good , i can 't lie . "
but the staff was so hor@@ ri@@ ble to us .
the ho@@ st@@ ess and the wa@@ it@@ re@@ ss were incre@@ di@@ bly ru@@ de and did everything they could to ru@@ sh us out .
we were planning to get des@@ sert but the wa@@ it@@ re@@ ss basi@@ cally through the bill at us before we had a chance to order .
" this place is pri@@ ce@@ y , and yes , the food is worth it ; but the service makes you feel like you should be pay@@ ing a quat@@ er of the price . "
save yourself the time and trouble and ski@@ p this one !
amma is nothing special .
i ate here a week ago and found most dis@@ hes aver@@ age at best and too expen@@ sive .
will not be back .
" don 't dine at tam@@ ar@@ ind for the veget@@ arian dis@@ hes , they are simply not up to par with the non-@@ ve@@ g selec@@ tions . "
dec@@ or is nice though service can be spot@@ ty .
this place is always pac@@ ked .
" most importan@@ tly , food is excellent . "
try the sea bas@@ s .
high@@ ly recom@@ men@@ ded .
first of all dal bu@@ k@@ hara ro@@ cks .
i am happy i did the food was aw@@ some .
just aw@@ some .
and yes dal bu@@ k@@ hara is so dam good and so are all the ka@@ bab@@ s .
but over@@ all i give it a 10
10
har@@ u on park s is simply dis@@ gu@@ sting .
the fish was not fre@@ sh and the rice ta@@ sted old and st@@ ale .
" quite fran@@ k@@ ly , this is some of the wor@@ st su@@ shi i have ever tried . "
will never be back .
hon@@ est@@ ly the wor@@ st su@@ shi my husband and i had in our entire lives .
not sure why this restau@@ rant would be rat@@ ed that high@@ ly .
the all-@@ u-@@ can@@ -@@ eat su@@ shi is defin@@ it@@ ely in very poor quality .
" limited menu , no-@@ so-@@ fre@@ sh ingre@@ di@@ ents , thin@@ ly@@ -@@ sli@@ ced fish , fall@@ -@@ apart rice . "
" the only things u could really taste are the very sal@@ ty soy sau@@ ce ( even its low sodi@@ um ) , the vin@@ eg@@ ar-@@ so@@ ak@@ ed rice , and the sc@@ alli@@ on on top of the fish . "
the wa@@ it@@ sta@@ ff@@ s are nice though .
w@@ ont come back again for sure !
i have been to ro@@ th 's twi@@ ce and both times were very dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting .
" both times i was extremely dis@@ sap@@ pointed by the service , which was bo@@ ar@@ der@@ line ru@@ de . "
they w@@ ou@@ l@@ dn@@ t even let me fin@@ ish my gla@@ ss of w@@ ine before offer@@ ing another .
much of the time it seems like they do not care about you .
" the din@@ ner was ok , nothing i would have again . "
" i had their eg@@ gs ben@@ edi@@ ct for br@@ un@@ ch , which were the wor@@ st in my entire life , i tried remo@@ ving the hol@@ lon@@ da@@ ise sau@@ ce completely that was how fai@@ led it was . "
this was a great sur@@ prise .
with the the@@ ater 2 blo@@ cks away we had a deli@@ ci@@ ous me@@ al in a beautiful room .
the service was atten@@ tive .
i look forward to e@@ ating here again
planet th@@ ai is great !
" we love the food , drin@@ ks , and at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here ! "
" the sv@@ c can be a bit ru@@ de at times , es@@ p if you have big group , but over@@ all the restau@@ rant is a must ! "
" try the pad th@@ ai , it 's fa@@ bul@@ ous and their prices are so che@@ ap ! "
" just because it 's che@@ ap does not mean the por@@ tions are small or the food is nast@@ y , it is great ! "
" they for@@ got a sand@@ wi@@ ch , didn 't include pla@@ stic for@@ ks , and didn 't include p@@ ita with the hum@@ mus plat@@ ter . "
" also , the sand@@ wi@@ ches ( ne@@ aring $ 7 ) didn 't come with anything like chi@@ ps or a side . "
" over@@ all , not worth the money . "
" e@@ ating in , the at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here sa@@ ves it , but at your des@@ k , it 's a very dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting experience . "
chen@@ nai garden is my favor@@ ite indi@@ an restau@@ rant in the city .
they have auth@@ enti@@ c indi@@ an at amaz@@ in prices .
this restau@@ rant is veget@@ arian ; there are no me@@ at dis@@ hes what@@ soever .
the se@@ ats are un@@ com@@ for@@ table if you are sitting against the wall on wo@@ o@@ den ben@@ ches .
it 's a rather c@@ ram@@ ped and bu@@ sy restau@@ rant and it clo@@ ses early .
pat@@ ro@@ on fe@@ atures a nice ci@@ gar bar and has great staff .
the food is ta@@ sty and por@@ tion siz@@ es are appropriate .
this is a nice restau@@ rant if you are looking for a good place to ho@@ st an in@@ tim@@ ate din@@ ner meeting with business associ@@ ates .
not a great place for family or general din@@ ing .
llo@@ ov@@ ve this place .
food is excellent .
fish is so very fre@@ sh .
wa@@ it@@ staff are very fri@@ end@@ ly .
love yu@@ ka .
mer@@ ma@@ id inn is an over@@ all good restau@@ rant with really good se@@ af@@ o@@ od .
the menu is limited but almost all of the dis@@ hes are excellent .
the lob@@ ster sand@@ wi@@ ch is good and the spa@@ ghet@@ ti with sc@@ allo@@ ps and sh@@ rim@@ p is great .
the service is good and ambi@@ ence is good for a date or group ou@@ ting .
the only fall@@ back on this restau@@ rant is the prices .
" even though its good se@@ af@@ o@@ od , the prices are too high . "
the lob@@ ster sand@@ wi@@ ch is $ 24 and although it was good it was not near@@ ly enough to war@@ rant that price .
we were very ple@@ as@@ ant@@ ly sur@@ pris@@ ed .
" the food was deli@@ ci@@ ous ( i had a h@@ ali@@ but special , my husband had ste@@ ak ) , and the service was top@@ -@@ not@@ ch . "
" when my des@@ sert came , there was a c@@ and@@ le in it - not because anyone asked for one - but because the wa@@ iter must have seen me opening my bir@@ th@@ day card and gift , and said he knew it was a special oc@@ cas@@ sion of some sort . "
truly the mark of an atten@@ tive wa@@ iter .
i high@@ ly recom@@ mend the restau@@ rant based on our experience last night .
we ate at this th@@ ai place following the re@@ views but very un@@ happy with the fo@@ ods .
we thought that this place is using too much of ms@@ g co@@ oking in the fo@@ ods .
" they don 't concern much of cu@@ stom@@ er 's health , just want to make money . "
please don 't fo@@ ol us .
" i recom@@ mend the j@@ ell@@ y fish , dr@@ un@@ ken chi@@ cken and the sou@@ p@@ y dum@@ pl@@ ings , certainly the st@@ ir fr@@ y blue cra@@ b . "
the food is so che@@ ap and the wa@@ it@@ ers are nice .
" of course , it is crow@@ ded but who car@@ es . "
auth@@ enti@@ c sh@@ ang@@ hai sty@@ le and i cannot recom@@ mend a better sh@@ ang@@ hai place in new york .
have frequ@@ ent@@ ed ' ino for several years and the food remains excellent .
che@@ ese pl@@ ate is a vari@@ ed deli@@ ght and great bar@@ gain at $ 10 .
" the large selec@@ tion of bru@@ sch@@ et@@ tas , pan@@ inis , tram@@ ez@@ zin@@ is keep the pal@@ ate from sta@@ gn@@ ating . "
" ( the as@@ para@@ gus , tru@@ ff@@ le oil , par@@ mes@@ an bru@@ sch@@ etta is a win@@ ner ! ) "
w@@ ine list is exten@@ sive without being over@@ -@@ pri@@ ced .
" be sure to try the se@@ as@@ on@@ al , and always deli@@ ci@@ ous , speci@@ als . "
defin@@ it@@ ely a neigh@@ bor@@ hood favor@@ ite .
i lo@@ ved this place ! !
i almost he@@ si@@ ti@@ tate to write a review because the at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here was so great and i would h@@ ate for it too become to crow@@ ded .
" the food was very good , a great deal , and the place its self was great . "
" the wait staff is very fre@@ ind@@ ly , they make it feel like you 're e@@ ating in a fre@@ ind@@ ly little european town . "
" i like ca@@ fe no@@ ir dont get me wrong , it is j@@ su@@ t that the people who work there are evil and in@@ compet@@ ent ! ! "
" the service was terrible , we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be ser@@ ved . "
" the wa@@ it@@ re@@ ss , seems to be more concerned of looking good than actually wa@@ it@@ ress@@ ing . "
" after din@@ ner the manag@@ er gra@@ b@@ bed my boy@@ friend , asked him : where are you from ... maybe you dont know how things work in america ... and in the end stor@@ med away almost te@@ ar@@ ey@@ ed y@@ elling that ti@@ ps are the only thing they sur@@ vive on . "
" we did tip , i guess the model / wa@@ it@@ re@@ ss just wanted more and compla@@ ined to the manag@@ er . "
" the whole set up is truly un@@ profession@@ al and i wish ca@@ fe no@@ ir would get some good staff , because despite the current one this is a great place . "
pi@@ zza here is consist@@ ently good .
sal@@ ads are a deli@@ ci@@ ous way to begin the me@@ al .
you should pass on the cal@@ am@@ ari .
it is thi@@ ck and sli@@ gh@@ tly so@@ g@@ gy .
dec@@ or is char@@ ming .
service is aver@@ age .
what a great place .
" the ambi@@ ence was so f@@ un , and the prices were great , on top of the fact that the food was really ta@@ sty . "
" i wasn 't th@@ ri@@ l@@ led to have to wait on line for thir@@ ty minutes , but i guess that 's the price you pay for a popular place . "
i would defin@@ it@@ ely recom@@ mend sea if you like th@@ ai cu@@ is@@ ine !
i was here a few weeks back and we had the wor@@ st cu@@ stom@@ er service experience at a restau@@ rant ever .
" a gentlem@@ an , maybe the manag@@ er , came to our table , and without so much as a smi@@ le or gre@@ et@@ ing asked for our order . "
" when asked about how a certain dis@@ h was prepared in compar@@ ison to a similar at other th@@ ai restau@@ ran@@ ts , he repli@@ ed this is not mc@@ donald 's , every place makes things differ@@ ently "
" while it is under@@ stan@@ dable that every place is indeed different , there was not a need to be un@@ cour@@ te@@ ous to cu@@ stom@@ ers and dow@@ n@@ right ru@@ de . "
never again !
i absolutely lo@@ ved this place .
" excellent at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here , deli@@ ci@@ ous dis@@ hes good and fri@@ end@@ ly service . "
this is can became on e of the ny italian food fare institutions .
i think that it is absolutely bri@@ lli@@ ant and well run@@ ned business operation .
the w@@ ine list is also really nice .
" everything was wonder@@ ful ; food , drin@@ ks , staff , mi@@ le@@ au . "
i would high@@ ly recom@@ mend this place !
i have been to ca@@ si@@ mir over 5 times and i have always had a great time there .
the food is great and reas@@ on@@ ably pri@@ ced .
" i have tried to make reserva@@ tions , but both times , the ho@@ st@@ ess didn 't have my name . "
" if the we@@ at@@ her is nice , try to sna@@ g an outside table . "
" the staff has been nice , but they se@@ em@@ ed really stre@@ ssed and the un@@ is@@ ex bat@@ h@@ room needs to be cle@@ an@@ ed more often . "
my boy@@ friend and i went there to celebr@@ ate my bir@@ th@@ day the other night and all i can say is that it was mag@@ ni@@ fic@@ ent .
" from the spe@@ cta@@ cu@@ lar ca@@ vi@@ ar to the hospit@@ able wa@@ it@@ staff , i felt like ro@@ yal@@ ty and enjo@@ yed every second of it . "
" consider@@ ing we were the last patr@@ ons there and it was after the clo@@ sing time , the wa@@ it@@ staff did not ru@@ sh us at all and made us feel com@@ for@@ table and rela@@ x@@ ed . "
i high@@ ly recom@@ mend ca@@ vi@@ ar ru@@ sse to anyone who wants deli@@ ci@@ ous top gra@@ de ca@@ vi@@ ar and fanta@@ stic service .
nice family ow@@ ned tradi@@ tional restau@@ rant .
fre@@ sh ingre@@ di@@ ents and everything is made to order .
i was ple@@ as@@ ant@@ ly sur@@ pris@@ ed to find this gem in ho@@ bo@@ ken .
fri@@ end@@ ly staff that actually let@@ s you enjo@@ y your me@@ al and the company you 're with .
" i found the food to be out@@ standing , particular@@ y the sal@@ mon dis@@ h i had . "
" i also or@@ dered the change moj@@ ito , which was out of this world . "
" my friends sett@@ led for rice dis@@ hes , but we came back the following day to try the dim sum , which was good ... not out@@ standing , but good . "
" we ate out in the back pati@@ o , which is worth it as it 's co@@ ol and the music is hear well there . "
" over@@ all , excellent restau@@ rant ! "
the food was good .
the place was nice and cal@@ m .
but the service was a bit slo@@ w .
the bu@@ ffet had a nice selec@@ tion .
the food was aver@@ age or above including some sur@@ pris@@ ing ta@@ sty dis@@ hes .
service was also very good .
i would go back .
i got an excellent pie@@ ce of che@@ es@@ ec@@ ake and we had several other nice pa@@ stri@@ es .
" i would recom@@ mend ro@@ x@@ y 's for that , but not for their food . "
my son and his gir@@ l@@ friend both wanted che@@ es@@ e@@ burgers and they were huge !
" but , they were too big for the bun . "
" consequ@@ ently , their burgers fel@@ l apart in their hands and made such a mes@@ s that they did '@@ nt feel like fin@@ ish@@ ing them . "
also they were $ 15 each !
i had a huge pa@@ str@@ ami sand@@ wi@@ ch on a roll .
it was $ 14 not really bad for a po@@ und of pa@@ str@@ ami@@ -@@ but it didn 't have much ta@@ ste@@ -i 've had better for less el@@ se@@ where !
" this place is really tren@@ di but they have for@@ go@@ tten about the most important part of a restau@@ rant , the food . "
" the last two times i or@@ dered from here my food was soo spi@@ cy that i could bar@@ ely eat it , and the spi@@ ce took away from the fla@@ vor of the dis@@ h . "
and the tom k@@ ha sou@@ p was pat@@ he@@ tic .
if you want good auth@@ enti@@ c th@@ ai this place is not the place to go .
" we went here for lun@@ ch a couple of weeks ago on a sat@@ ur@@ day , and i was thor@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly im@@ pres@@ sed with the food . "
" the p@@ esto pi@@ zza was excellent , th@@ in-@@ cru@@ st pi@@ zza with a nice amount of spi@@ cy italian che@@ ese that i 'd never heard of before . "
" conven@@ i@@ ently lo@@ cated too , being right on bed@@ ford ave . "
" the back garden sitting area is very ple@@ as@@ ant , where you can see their personal her@@ b garden . "
i will defin@@ et@@ ly be going back .
we had the lob@@ ster sand@@ wi@@ ch and it was fanta@@ stic .
" my husband said he could 've e@@ aten several more , the por@@ tion was fine for me he even ex@@ cla@@ i@@ med that the french fri@@ es were the best he has had . "
we had the sc@@ allo@@ ps as an ap@@ peti@@ zer and they were deli@@ ci@@ ous and the sau@@ ce was wonder@@ ful .
we wa@@ it@@ ed at the bar and had mar@@ tin@@ is that were just right .
we will be back .
love the food .
it 's the only place you can get y@@ um@@ my auth@@ enti@@ c japan@@ ese com@@ fort food .
and you can 't be@@ at the prices .
high@@ ly recom@@ men@@ ded .
i 've li@@ ved in ny for 5 years and this place has it all .
" great food , good size menu , great service and an un@@ preten@@ si@@ ous set@@ ting . "
" the dis@@ hes offer@@ ed were unique , very ta@@ sty and fre@@ sh from the lam@@ b sau@@ sa@@ ges , sar@@ din@@ es with bis@@ cu@@ its , large whole sh@@ rim@@ p to the amaz@@ ing pi@@ sta@@ chio ice cre@@ am ( the best and fre@@ sh@@ est i 've ever had ) . "
i 'm glad i was introdu@@ ced to this place and this is a rare gem in ny .
" the fre@@ sh@@ est , best vari@@ ety , and the fast@@ est deli@@ very . "
also very in@@ expen@@ sive .
a great cho@@ ice at any cost and a great deal .
the service was excellent and the food was deli@@ ci@@ ous .
" we are very particular about su@@ shi and were both please with every cho@@ ice which included : ce@@ vi@@ che mi@@ x ( special ) , cra@@ b dum@@ pl@@ ings , as@@ sor@@ ted sa@@ sh@@ imi , su@@ shi and ro@@ lls , two types of sake , and the ban@@ ana tem@@ pura . "
defin@@ it@@ ely a great spo@@ t for a nice occasion or date .
" aver@@ age to good th@@ ai food , but terrible deli@@ very . "
i 've wa@@ it@@ ed over one hour for food .
they were very ab@@ ru@@ pt with me when i called and actually cla@@ i@@ med the food was late because they were out of rice .
a th@@ ai restau@@ rant out of rice during din@@ ner ?
" the food arri@@ ved 20 minutes after i called , col@@ d and so@@ g@@ gy . "
this is a wonder@@ ful place on all stand points especially value of@@ r money .
an excellent service
we were gre@@ et@@ ed pro@@ mp@@ tly by the wa@@ iter who was very nice and cordi@@ al .
she was very hel@@ p@@ ful in suggest@@ ing us drin@@ ks and hel@@ ped us in or@@ dering a lot of good dis@@ hes since we knew nothing about indi@@ an food .
the food looked very ap@@ peti@@ zing and deli@@ ci@@ ous since it came on a vari@@ ety of fan@@ cy plat@@ es .
we en@@ ded our great experience by having gu@@ la@@ b jam@@ un ( des@@ sert ) recom@@ men@@ ded by the wa@@ iter .
i than@@ ked my friend who recom@@ men@@ ded me this restau@@ rant and will certainly recom@@ mend it to others .
" service here was great , food was fanta@@ stic . "
" gu@@ ac@@ am@@ ole + sh@@ rim@@ p ap@@ peti@@ zer was really great , we both had the fil@@ et , very good , didn 't much like the fr@@ ites that came with , but the fil@@ et was so good , neither of us car@@ ed . "
will absolutely visit again .
you cannot go wrong with this place .
" the food is out@@ standing and the service is qui@@ ck , fri@@ end@@ ly and very profession@@ al . "
" always a nice cro@@ wd , but never lou@@ d . "
go here .
good for dat@@ es or with friends .
i am re@@ luc@@ tant to write because i would not want my jem of a pi@@ zza place to become over@@ crow@@ ded .
" however , it is jus too good to not praise it . "
" by far , the best pi@@ zza in man@@ hat@@ tan . "
" the cru@@ st is th@@ in , the ingre@@ di@@ ents are fre@@ sh and the staff is fri@@ end@@ ly . "
the menu has so many fish it@@ ems and oy@@ sters .
" the fish was really , really fre@@ sh . "
we all agreed that mare is one of the best se@@ af@@ o@@ od restau@@ ran@@ ts in new york .
i stum@@ bled upon this great pi@@ z@@ zer@@ ia as i explor@@ ed my new neigh@@ bor@@ hood .
all of the pi@@ z@@ zas are terri@@ fic and the price is even better !
i high@@ ly recom@@ mend the so@@ ph@@ ia pi@@ zza .
it 's to die for !
the food was medi@@ oc@@ re at best but it was the hor@@ ri@@ ble service that made me vo@@ w never to go back .
" immediately after we paid , the wa@@ iter took the money and said , okay , you gu@@ ys are ou@@ tta here . "
so ru@@ sh@@ ing us out was absolutely un@@ necessary !
" for the people who want great food plus great service , ro@@ x@@ y is a place to avoid ! "
" the first time the su@@ shi was out@@ standing , the second time it was a little bland . "
i 'm sure i 'll return for a final jud@@ gement tho .
" the b@@ lon@@ d wood dec@@ or is very so@@ o@@ thing , the premi@@ um sake is excellent and the service is great . "
mi@@ zu is the jap@@ en@@ ese find in gram@@ mercy .
" while their kit@@ chen food is deli@@ ci@@ ous , their su@@ shi is out of this world . "
mi@@ zu is home to cre@@ ative and unique ro@@ lls not to found any@@ where else .
" not only is the cu@@ is@@ ine the best around , the service has always been atten@@ tive and char@@ ming . "
war@@ ning : you may find it difficult to dine at other japan@@ ese restau@@ ran@@ ts after a visit to mi@@ zu !
" th@@ alia is a beautiful restau@@ rant with beautiful people ser@@ ving you , but the food doesn 't quite mat@@ ch up . "
i or@@ dered the smo@@ ked sal@@ mon and ro@@ e ap@@ peti@@ zer and it was off fla@@ vor .
" the entre@@ e was bland and small , des@@ sert was not inspi@@ red . "
i expe@@ cted quite a bit more from such an expen@@ sive menu .
" the view is spe@@ cta@@ cu@@ lar , and the food is great . "
wonder@@ ful stra@@ w@@ ber@@ ry da@@ i@@ qui@@ ries as well !
defin@@ it@@ ely worth the tri@@ p to bat@@ ter@@ y park city !
one of my favor@@ ite places in man@@ hat@@ tan .
auth@@ enti@@ c tai@@ wan@@ ese food that 's che@@ ap ... what more could you ask for ?
( besides that there should be more restau@@ ran@@ ts like it around the city ) .
the col@@ d ap@@ peti@@ zer dis@@ hes taste like the way i remember them to taste when i was gro@@ wing up in taiwan .
deli@@ ci@@ ous simple food in nice out@@ door at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here .
" kind , atten@@ tive wait staff . "
i really like both the sc@@ allo@@ ps and the mah@@ i mah@@ i ( on sa@@ ff@@ ron ris@@ ot@@ to-@@ y@@ um ! ) .
my friend de@@ vou@@ red her chi@@ cken and mas@@ hed po@@ tat@@ os .
deli@@ ci@@ ous cra@@ b c@@ akes too .
" even if the food wasn 't this good , the garden is a great place to sit outside and rela@@ x . "
great neigh@@ bor@@ hood joint .
this is a nice pi@@ zza place with good selec@@ tion of th@@ in cru@@ st pi@@ zza including the ba@@ sil sli@@ ce .
" their cal@@ zones are hor@@ ri@@ fic , bad , v@@ om@@ it-@@ indu@@ cing , yu@@ ck . "
they s@@ mel@@ l like they stu@@ ff them with old can@@ ned veget@@ ables like the sp@@ in@@ ach mu@@ sh@@ room cal@@ zone .
the coun@@ ter service is bad .
they charge different prices all the time .
" they 're ru@@ de at times , and not very fri@@ end@@ ly . "
no pi@@ zza 33 for me !
" any@@ body who lik@@ es this place must be from a different planet , where gre@@ as@@ y , dry and ta@@ stel@@ ess are compli@@ ment@@ ary . "
" the do@@ sas are sk@@ imp@@ y , un@@ attra@@ ctive and dri@@ p with gre@@ ase , and person@@ ally i 'd drink pop@@ cor@@ n to@@ pping before i 'd eat another one of these . "
" the sand@@ wi@@ ches are dry , ta@@ stel@@ ess and way over@@ pri@@ ced . "
" calling the place ham@@ p@@ ton ch@@ ut@@ ney co@@ . does war@@ n you that these fol@@ ks offer more sty@@ le than sub@@ stance , but in this un@@ attra@@ ctive room with un@@ hel@@ p@@ ful c@@ ler@@ ks there was a de@@ ar@@ th of the former too . "
" seriously , this place ki@@ cks as@@ s . "
" the at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here is un@@ her@@ al@@ ded , the service impe@@ ci@@ ble , and the food mag@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant . "
" best italian food i ever had ( and being italian , that means al@@ ot ) . "
" it is near@@ ly impossible to get a table , so if you ever have the chance to go here for din@@ ner , do not pass it up . "
" this is such a lo@@ vely , pe@@ ac@@ eful place to eat outside . "
the restau@@ rant looks out over beautiful green law@@ ns to the hud@@ son river and the stat@@ ue of liber@@ ty .
" it is set far from the small street it 's on , and there is no traf@@ fic no@@ ise . "
" the food is good , especially their more basic dis@@ hes , and the drin@@ ks are deli@@ ci@@ ous . "
" this is a great place to take ou@@ t-@@ of@@ -@@ to@@ wn@@ ers , and perfect for wat@@ ching the sun@@ set . "
great su@@ shi experience .
nice value .
unique app@@ peti@@ z@@ ers .
try su@@ sh@@ imi cu@@ cum@@ ber roll .
" good spre@@ ads , great be@@ ver@@ age selec@@ tions and ba@@ gel@@ s really ta@@ sty . "
the big compla@@ int : no to@@ ast@@ ing available .
mur@@ ray won 't do it .
won 't or can 't is not in the service direc@@ tor@@ y .
but who says mur@@ ray 's is anything about service .
" so close , but not good enough . "
don 't be fo@@ oled by crow@@ ds of people .
the service is aw@@ ful .
this place is not worth the prices .
" also , don 't plan on asking for your favor@@ ite roll , if it 's not on the menu , you can 't have it . "
love pi@@ zza 33 ..
i will be out with friends and all of a sud@@ den i am hun@@ gry and i only cra@@ ve one thing ... their pi@@ zza .
it h@@ its the spo@@ t every time
this tin@@ y william@@ s@@ burg spo@@ t is always ple@@ as@@ ant@@ ly sur@@ pris@@ ing .
the pi@@ zza is deli@@ ci@@ ous and the propri@@ et@@ or is one of the nic@@ est in ny@@ c .
i 've been many time and have never been dis@@ appointed .
they even sco@@ op it out nice ( for those on a di@@ et ) not too much not to little .
the cre@@ am che@@ eses are out of this world and i love that co@@ ffee ! !
a little crow@@ ded but they move that line really fast !
a little pri@@ ce@@ y but it really h@@ its the spo@@ t on a sun@@ day morning !
" ba@@ gel@@ s are ok , but be sure not to make any special re@@ quest@@ s ! "
i asked for an open fac@@ ed che@@ ese sand@@ wi@@ ch and the manag@@ er basi@@ cally told me to take my business el@@ se@@ where !
be sure not to get anything other than ba@@ gel@@ s ! ..
the turkey burgers are scar@@ y !
the wor@@ st excuse for japan@@ ese food i 've ever en@@ coun@@ ter@@ ed .
the sou@@ p for the ud@@ on was soy sau@@ ce and water .
the su@@ shi was aw@@ ful !
the rice was poor quality and was co@@ o@@ ked so ba@@ dly it was hard .
" furthermore , the rice had no se@@ as@@ on@@ ing , so the su@@ shi was bland and dis@@ gu@@ sting . "
" the fish was adequate , but in@@ exper@@ tly sli@@ ced . "
it is obvi@@ ous that no one in the restau@@ rant has any idea about or experience with japan@@ ese cu@@ is@@ ine .
" good , fast service . "
i would high@@ ly recom@@ mend .
food is great and in@@ expen@@ sive .
the lo@@ cation is perfect .
give it a try and enjo@@ y .
" well , this place is so ghet@@ to its not even fun@@ ny . "
if you like your music bla@@ sted and the system is@@ nt that great and if you want to pay at least 100 dollar bo@@ tt@@ le minim@@ un then you 'll love it here .
would never go back there .
aw@@ some pi@@ zza especially the mar@@ g@@ her@@ it@@ ta sli@@ ce .
always bu@@ sy but fast mo@@ ving .
great at@@ mo@@ sh@@ ere and worth every bit .
open late ( well as late as i ever got there and i 'm a night person )
win@@ nie and her staff are the best cre@@ w you can find ser@@ ving you .
the food is reli@@ able and the price is moder@@ ate .
what more can you ask for ?
" for auth@@ enti@@ c th@@ ai food , look no further than to@@ ons . "
" try the pad th@@ ai , or sam@@ ple anything on the ap@@ peti@@ zer menu ... they 're all deli@@ ci@@ ous . "
everything about this restau@@ rant was special .
" the service was atten@@ tive , yet discre@@ et . "
the f@@ lavor@@ s ro@@ bu@@ st and sub@@ tle .
the bri@@ o@@ che and lol@@ lies as party favor@@ s is a cu@@ te and s@@ weet tou@@ ch to a most memor@@ able me@@ al .
i 'm sa@@ ving up for my next visit .
the place was qui@@ et and deli@@ gh@@ t@@ ful .
service was good and food is wonder@@ ful .
i did not try the ca@@ vi@@ ar but i tried their sal@@ mon and cra@@ b sala@@ d ( they are all good )
it is defin@@ it@@ ely a good spo@@ t for sna@@ cks and ch@@ at .
" as a reti@@ red hi@@ p@@ ster , i can say with some degre@@ e of certain@@ ty that for the last year lu@@ cky stri@@ ke has been the best la@@ id-@@ back late night in the city . "
" the wait staff is ple@@ as@@ ant , f@@ un , and for the most part gor@@ ge@@ ous ( in the wonder@@ ful a@@ est@@ he@@ tic beau@@ ti@@ fication way , not in that she '@@ s-@@ wa@@ y-@@ cu@@ ter@@ -@@ than@@ -@@ me-@@ that@@ -@@ b @ # $ * way ) . "
" the food is y@@ um@@ my , especially their co@@ o@@ ke@@ d-@@ to-@@ perfec@@ tion mu@@ ss@@ els in spi@@ cy tom@@ ato sau@@ ce and their sho@@ est@@ ring cris@@ p@@ y fri@@ es . "
" but the best part about ls is the late night at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here , deli@@ gh@@ t@@ fully free of the b@@ ts . "
" you can get a completely del@@ ish mart@@ ini in a gla@@ ss ( that 's about 2 1 / 2 drin@@ ks ) for $ 8@@ .@@ 50 ( i recom@@ mend the van@@ illa shan@@ ty , m@@ m@@ mm ! ) in a great hom@@ ey set@@ ting with great music . "
" the in-@@ house lady d@@ j on sat@@ ur@@ day ni@@ ghts has ou@@ trage@@ ously good taste in music , and moreover , takes re@@ quest@@ s . "
you can 't go wrong with this place .
su@@ an is a great place that i often take my friends ( cla@@ ss@@ mat@@ es ) too .
" its lo@@ cation is good and the fact that hu@@ tn@@ er colle@@ ge is near and their prices are very reas@@ onable , makes students go back to su@@ an again and again . "
i love their th@@ ai
nood@@ les with sh@@ rim@@ p and chi@@ cken and co@@ con@@ ut ju@@ ice is the must !
i will go back to su@@ an soon !
in sum@@ mer@@ -@@ eat outside on a ter@@ race ( another great fe@@ ature of su@@ an ) ! ! !
i cannot imagine a fri@@ end@@ lier staff working in a restau@@ rant .
i cannot imagine better indi@@ an food in all of the city .
i cannot imagine you not ru@@ sh@@ ing out to eat there .
" during the course of the past 3 months , the chef and staff changed and it was not for the better . "
i wish they would change back to what it was before .
the food now is in@@ consist@@ ent .
this is the kind of place you 'd like to take all your friends to and still keep a secret .
the set@@ ting is ca@@ su@@ al and roman@@ tic .
prices are very good .
the food is excellent !
" if you 're dar@@ ing , try the bal@@ sam@@ ic vin@@ egar over i@@ ce@@ cre@@ am , it 's wonder@@ ful ! "
" do not get the go go ham@@ burgers , no matter what the re@@ views say . "
they were such a ri@@ p-@@ off ( $ 8@@ .@@ 95 for four small me@@ at pat@@ ties in ste@@ am@@ ed bun@@ s ) and not worth trying .
" the rest of the dim sum , though pri@@ ce@@ y by chin@@ at@@ own standards , is worth it . "
ste@@ am@@ ed fre@@ sh so brought hot hot hot to your table .
" the wait here is long for dim sum , but if you don 't like shar@@ ing ta@@ bles or if the ty@@ pi@@ cal rau@@ c@@ ous dim sum at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here is not your gig , this is a sle@@ ek ( for chin@@ at@@ own ) alternative . "
" a few ti@@ ps : ski@@ p the tur@@ ni@@ p c@@ ake , ro@@ ast por@@ k bun@@ s and eg@@ g cu@@ star@@ ds . "
these are over@@ pri@@ ced and you can get better just around the cor@@ ner :
i was ple@@ as@@ ant@@ ly su@@ pris@@ ed .
the food was excep@@ tional .
" i cho@@ ose to go with one of the special , the bra@@ ised lam@@ b shan@@ k in red w@@ ine , which was excellent . "
the service was fri@@ end@@ ly and the at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here was ca@@ su@@ al .
the restau@@ rant is a bit no@@ is@@ y but that is something that can be over@@ looked once you sit down and enjo@@ y a great me@@ al
this little place has a cu@@ te interior dec@@ or and af@@ for@@ dable city prices .
" the pad se e@@ w chi@@ cken was deli@@ ci@@ ous , however the pad th@@ ai was far too o@@ ily . "
" have e@@ aten at g@@ inger house several times , and it 's always good . "
the fri@@ ed dum@@ pl@@ ings are great !
finally a reli@@ able chinese restau@@ rant !
this place would be so much better ser@@ ved by being run by a group that actually under@@ stands cu@@ stom@@ er service .
" the only thing you can do here is walk in and eat .. but planning an event , especially a small , in@@ tim@@ ate one , forget about it . "
" they are not hel@@ p@@ ful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date ro@@ lls around you will not only regret ch@@ os@@ ing this place , but also become ho@@ sti@@ le ! "
" nobody at this restau@@ rant will give firm ans@@ wers about anything and in the end , not one person takes responsibility for anything . "
" terrible , terrible management - deser@@ ves to be shu@@ t-@@ down . "
never fa@@ ils to please .
" deli@@ ci@@ ous ba@@ gel@@ s , especially when right out of the oven . "
spre@@ ads and topp@@ ings are great - though a bit pri@@ ce@@ y .
service is fast and fri@@ end@@ ly .
" only dra@@ w@@ back - they won 't to@@ ast your ba@@ gel , and they don 't make eg@@ gs for the ba@@ gel . "
but that is high@@ ly forgi@@ va@@ ble .
" been there , done that , and new york , it 's not that big a deal . "
" the food is dec@@ ent at best , and the ambi@@ ence , well , it 's a matter of opinion , some may consider it to be a s@@ weet thing , i thought it was just anno@@ ying . "
" if celeb@@ ri@@ ties make you swe@@ at , then your in for a ri@@ de , but if your like most around these parts then you 'll just ya@@ wn and wonder wh@@ ats with all the hy@@ pe . "
" ra@@ o is a good restau@@ rant , but it 's nothing special . "
" but after last night , spi@@ ce gri@@ ll is the only place i 'm e@@ ating indi@@ an cu@@ is@@ ine . "
you must try the sh@@ rim@@ p ap@@ peti@@ z@@ ers .
even my indi@@ an friend couldn 't believe how good and ta@@ sty everything was .
this place has the the correct ambi@@ ence and an excellent staff to make you feel like a gu@@ est and a friend at the same time .
" great food , great prices , great service . "
" if you are looking for a good quality , che@@ ap e@@ ats - this is the place . "
it 's a perfect place to have a aman@@ zing indi@@ an food .
i really lo@@ ved the different and inov@@ ated tou@@ ch that 's the chef@@ f gives to the food .
" also it 's great to have din@@ ner in a very roman@@ tic and confor@@ table place , the service it 's just perfect ... they 're so fr@@ end@@ ly that we never want to live the place ! "
" their ba@@ gel@@ s are fine , but they are a little over@@ co@@ o@@ ked , and not really a ' special ' ba@@ gel experience . "
great ba@@ gel@@ s made the ol@@ d-@@ fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ed way .
dra@@ w@@ bac@@ ks : service is slo@@ w and they don 't to@@ ast !
the food was absolutely amaz@@ ing ! !
the bak@@ ed clam@@ s octo@@ pus we shar@@ ed as ap@@ peti@@ z@@ ers were the best we 've ever had ! !
" the lam@@ b was ten@@ der so full of fla@@ vor , the des@@ sert was div@@ ine ! ! "
the wa@@ iter was atten@@ tive .
the place itself is beautiful the bar sc@@ ene seems to be happen@@ ing .
" dow@@ n@@ town din@@ ner 2002 - pri@@ xe fi@@ x : ap@@ peti@@ z@@ ers were ok , wa@@ iter gave me poor sug@@ gestion .. try the pot@@ ato stu@@ ff kan@@ ish best one . "
" small ser@@ v@@ ings for main entre@@ e , i had sal@@ mon ( was@@ nt im@@ pres@@ sed ) gir@@ l@@ friend had chi@@ cken , it was good . "
des@@ sert is a jo@@ ke ... dont bo@@ ther
" vol@@ are vir@@ gin@@ s or week@@ ly regular@@ s , everyone gets tre@@ ated the same and you can 't ask for more than that when the service is this fri@@ end@@ ly . "
" the restau@@ rant has a family feel , not least with regard to the por@@ tions which are enor@@ mous ; the ve@@ al alone could have sing@@ le-@@ han@@ de@@ dly sol@@ ved third world fam@@ ine . "
" the anti-@@ pa@@ sta was excellent , especially the cal@@ am@@ ari , as were the fil@@ ling pa@@ sta mains . "
the w@@ ine list is exten@@ sive and can easi@@ ly hike up an other@@ wise reas@@ on@@ ably pri@@ ced me@@ al .
" still , any qui@@ b@@ bles about the bill were off@@ -@@ set by the pour@@ -@@ your@@ -@@ own measures of li@@ qu@@ ers which were cour@@ tes@@ ey of the house ... "
fanta@@ stic place .
cu@@ te and de@@ cor@@ ative .
a ple@@ as@@ ant sur@@ prise .
go there to rela@@ x and feel like your some@@ where else .
lu@@ cky stri@@ ke is a great ca@@ su@@ al place to just gra@@ b a b@@ ite to eat .
" great food , great dec@@ or , great service . "
i recom@@ mend it !
" this is the perfect spo@@ t for meeting friends , having lun@@ ch , din@@ ner , pre@@ -@@ the@@ at@@ re or after@@ -@@ the@@ at@@ re drin@@ ks ! "
( always ask the bar@@ ten@@ der for the se@@ as@@ on@@ al be@@ er ! ! !
guarante@@ ed to be a ta@@ sty experience ! )
excellent spo@@ t for holi@@ day get toge@@ thers with co-@@ workers or friends that you haven 't seen in a while .
i have been doing all of the above at the hear@@ t@@ land bre@@ wer@@ y for over 5 years now and i have never been dis@@ appointed !
all the people that i bring there go back on their own and bring their friends !
go there once and oh yes ... you will go back ... you will ...
what a great place !
not the ty@@ pi@@ cal ny@@ c gi@@ m@@ mi@@ ck th@@ eme restau@@ rant .
" a co@@ ol bar with great food , and tons of excellent be@@ er . "
and even with it 's pu@@ b at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here they were great to my ki@@ ds too !
lo@@ ved it !
the sh@@ rim@@ p s@@ cam@@ pi was excellent and the anti@@ pasti were pl@@ enti@@ ful .
it is expen@@ sive but well worth the money .
" if you vent@@ ure off the island of man@@ hat@@ tan and can 't seem to find a great italian restau@@ rant , drive to cor@@ ona . "
the only thing more wonder@@ ful than the food ( which is excep@@ tional ) is the service .
the only thing the wa@@ it@@ ers don 't do for you is wi@@ pe your ch@@ in when you leave .
wonder@@ ful at holi@@ day time .
co@@ zy roman@@ tic at@@ omo@@ sp@@ here with only around 15 ta@@ bles at most .
service was very pro@@ mp@@ t but sli@@ gh@@ tly rus@@ hed .
" food was very good , but not what i would consider out of this world . "
go here for a roman@@ tic din@@ ner but not for an all out wo@@ w din@@ ing experience .
my friend from mil@@ an and myself were ple@@ as@@ ant@@ ly sur@@ pris@@ ed when we arri@@ ved and everyone spo@@ ke italian .
too bad the food wasn 't of the same her@@ ita@@ ge .
" the por@@ c@@ ini mu@@ sh@@ room pa@@ sta special was ta@@ stel@@ ess , so was the se@@ af@@ o@@ od ta@@ gli@@ at@@ elle . "
a real dis@@ sa@@ po@@ int@@ ment .
but that wasn 't the i@@ cing on the c@@ ake : a ti@@ ram@@ isu that re@@ semb@@ led nothing i have ever had .
they should have called it mas@@ car@@ pone with cho@@ col@@ ate chi@@ p@@ s-@@ good but a far c@@ ry from what the name impli@@ es .
pri@@ ced at up@@ per inter@@ medi@@ ate ran@@ ge .
i really li@@ ked this place .
" everything i had was good , and i 'm a e@@ ater . "
it was pretty in@@ expen@@ sive too .
this place has the best chinese sty@@ le bb@@ q ri@@ bs in the city .
i also recom@@ mend the rice dis@@ hes or the different var@@ ie@@ ties of con@@ ge@@ e ( rice por@@ ri@@ dge ) .
it 's great to go for a qui@@ ck lun@@ ch either alone or with a friend .
it 's defin@@ ately not a place to go if you want to impre@@ ss someone .
" however , if you want great food at a great price and don 't mind the dec@@ or , you can 't be@@ at this place . "
qui@@ ck and fri@@ end@@ ly service .
this is one of the best com@@ fort food places in the city .
it 's some@@ where you can eat and be happy .
" when you 're sitting in their main din@@ ing room ( which has a spe@@ cta@@ cu@@ lar , hand@@ -@@ pain@@ ted high ce@@ iling ) you 'd never know there was a world outside . "
" the food is wonder@@ ful , ta@@ sty and fil@@ ling , and the service is profession@@ al and fri@@ end@@ ly . "
" i can 't wait for sum@@ mer , when they serve outside on their gigan@@ tic pati@@ o . "
i recently tried su@@ an and i thought that it was great .
this little place defin@@ it@@ ely exce@@ eded my expecta@@ tions and you sure get a lot of food for your money .
the service was fast and fri@@ end@@ ly and the food was very ta@@ sty and they had the best hot sau@@ ce to add to your me@@ als .
i have to say that i am ple@@ as@@ ant@@ ly su@@ pris@@ ed and i will most likely stop in again if i am in the neigh@@ bor@@ hood .
they all know you .
good food .
good drink .
how do you rate home ?
i have never had che@@ esc@@ ake like this .
i thought i had died and gone to heaven .
" great spo@@ t , whether looking for a couple of drin@@ ks or qui@@ et din@@ ner . "
war@@ m and fri@@ end@@ ly in the win@@ ter and terri@@ fic out@@ door se@@ ating in the war@@ mer months .
the food is great and they have a good sele@@ ci@@ on of win@@ es at reas@@ onable prices .
have been several times and it never dis@@ sa@@ points .
we were less than im@@ pres@@ sed .
" while the ambi@@ ance and at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here were great , the food and service could have been a lot better . "
" we or@@ dered the chi@@ cken cas@@ ser@@ ole , but what we got were a few small pi@@ ec@@ es of chi@@ cken , all dar@@ k me@@ at and on the bone . "
probably would not go again ...

" the food was not fre@@ sh , the sau@@ ces were bland and very o@@ ily . "
it just wasn 't th@@ ai .
was sur@@ pris@@ ingly dis@@ appointed .
pi@@ zza was a little so@@ g@@ gy .
ra@@ vi@@ oli was good ... but i have to say that i found everything a bit over@@ pri@@ ced .
not enough win@@ es by the gla@@ ss either .
" service , however , was excellent ... and i li@@ ked the set@@ ting / at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here a lot . "
" food was just aver@@ age ... if they lo@@ wer@@ ed the prices just a bit , it would be a bi@@ gger draw . "
this place is a great bar@@ gain .
auth@@ enti@@ c pakist@@ ani food .
people are always fri@@ end@@ ly .
don 't waste money on dec@@ or .
" just straight up che@@ ap , good food . "
fa@@ an is so@@ oo good .
the best pad th@@ ai i 've ever had .
the de@@ sign and at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here is just as good .
bo@@ tt@@ les of w@@ ine are che@@ ap and good .
what more could you want ?
the food was actually aw@@ eful .
i 'm not pi@@ cky - but it was actually gro@@ ss .
" the mu@@ ss@@ les were the fis@@ hi@@ est things i 've ever ta@@ sted , the se@@ ab@@ as@@ s was bland , the go@@ at che@@ ese sala@@ d was mis@@ sing the go@@ at che@@ ese , the pen@@ ne w / chi@@ cken had bon@@ es in it ... it was dis@@ gu@@ sting . "
" nice at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here , the service was very ple@@ as@@ ant and the deser@@ t was good . "
wouldn 't recom@@ end it for din@@ ner !
this is the perfect date spo@@ t for william@@ s@@ burg cou@@ ples .
the ju@@ ke@@ bo@@ x pla@@ ys everything from italian opera to the stro@@ kes .
" the food is amaz@@ ing , rich pa@@ stas and fre@@ sh dou@@ gh@@ y pi@@ zza . "
" best of all is the war@@ m vi@@ be , the ow@@ ner is super fri@@ end@@ ly and service is fast . "
" if only they deli@@ ver@@ ed , they 'd make a mint ! "
go here for the drin@@ ks !
the drin@@ ks are amaz@@ ing and half off till 8@@ p@@ m .
" ask for u@@ sha , the nic@@ est bar@@ ten@@ der in man@@ hat@@ tan . "
my fa@@ v was the sa@@ ss@@ y la@@ ssi ...
this is an amaz@@ ing place to try some ro@@ ti ro@@ lls .
i really recom@@ mend the very simple unda ( eg@@ g ) ro@@ lls .
" deli@@ cate spi@@ ces , oni@@ ons , eg@@ gs and a ki@@ ck@@ -@@ as@@ s ro@@ ti . "
amaz@@ ing !
" to@@ ons has recently been red@@ one , so it 's now a very attra@@ ctive space . "
the food 's as good as ever .
" in an area sa@@ dly la@@ cking in dec@@ ent th@@ ai food , this is one of the best spo@@ ts . "
" went here last night - nice dec@@ or , good service , but the food was sur@@ pris@@ ingly excellent . "
" the por@@ tions are huge , so it might be good to order three things to sp@@ lit ( rather than one ap@@ peti@@ zer and entre@@ e per person ) for two people . "
can 't wait to go back .
best dru@@ m@@ sti@@ cks over rice and s@@ our spi@@ cy sou@@ p in town !
be@@ ef nood@@ le sou@@ p is good as well .
the service is good and the rest@@ ur@@ ant is clean .
best tai@@ wan@@ ese food in ny !
i have been to ra@@ o 's probably 15 times the past 3 years and it ke@@ ep@@ s getting better .
" for those that go once and don 't enjo@@ y it , all i can say is that they just don 't get it . "
ra@@ o 's has the best service and at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here in ny@@ c .
good lu@@ ck getting a table .
my ro@@ om@@ mate and i love this place .
" we recently decided to try this lo@@ cation , and to our deli@@ ght , they have out@@ door se@@ ating , perfect since i had my yor@@ kie with me . "
in@@ door was very co@@ zy and cu@@ te .
" the por@@ tion siz@@ es here are huge , and the su@@ shi is good . "
staff is very ac@@ com@@ od@@ ating .
" excellent dum@@ pl@@ ings ser@@ ved amid clean , chi@@ c dec@@ or . "
" i got the $ 10 10-@@ pie@@ ce dim sum com@@ bo , every b@@ ite of which was great . "
but $ 1 for each small pie@@ ce ? ? ?
not worth it .
i won 't go back unless someone else is foot@@ ing the bill .
the dec@@ or is very simple but com@@ for@@ table .
the food was deli@@ ci@@ ous but do not come here on a emp@@ ty stom@@ ach .
the por@@ tions are small but being that the food was so good makes up for that .
you must have the cra@@ b@@ me@@ at la@@ sag@@ na which is out of this world and the cho@@ col@@ ate bre@@ ad pu@@ d@@ ding for des@@ sert .
the staff there is very atten@@ tive and down to earth .
i lo@@ ved it and would go again .
great indi@@ an food and the service is incre@@ di@@ ble .
the ow@@ ner truly cat@@ ers to all your needs .
" when family came in he gave them ap@@ ps to test their pal@@ ets , and then or@@ dered for them . "
everyone was more then happy with his cho@@ i@@ ces .
great food and the prices are very reas@@ onable .
the food here does a great service to the name ( can@@ ton@@ ese that is ... ) .
i fel@@ l in love with the eg@@ g nood@@ les in the be@@ ef bro@@ th with sh@@ rim@@ p dum@@ pl@@ ings and sli@@ ces of bb@@ q ro@@ ast por@@ k .
this dis@@ h is my favor@@ ite and i always get it when i go there and never get ti@@ red of it .
" try the con@@ ge@@ e and the don@@ ut like de@@ ep fri@@ ed dou@@ gh they call o@@ w ley so@@ h , a deli@@ ci@@ ous and s@@ weet ta@@ sting bre@@ ad . "
simply some good ta@@ sting chinese food at incre@@ di@@ ble prices ...
service is not what you are coming here for ...
big w@@ ong is a great place to eat and fil@@ l your stom@@ ach .
" whoever the jaz@@ z duo was , they were on point . "
" good music , great food , spe@@ ed@@ y service af@@ for@@ dable prices . "
even the w@@ ine by the gla@@ ss was good .
" its a little out of the way if you don 't live in the neigh@@ bor@@ hood , but defin@@ it@@ ely worth the tri@@ p from wher@@ ever you are . "
consist@@ ently good japan@@ ese ta@@ pas .
always good drin@@ ks and service is pretty good ;
at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here is nice and rela@@ x@@ ed too ...
a great place to meet up for some food and drin@@ ks ...
yak@@ itori ( bb@@ q me@@ ats ) is ta@@ sty too .
" if you don 't mind pre@@ -@@ sli@@ ced low quality fish , un@@ fri@@ end@@ ly staff and a su@@ shi chef that looks like he is mis@@ er@@ able then this is your place . "
price and quality of fish alone will keep us from making a return visit .
wasn 't going to share but i feel oblig@@ ated ... while sitting at the su@@ shi bar din@@ ing we wat@@ ched the chef ac@@ cident@@ ally dro@@ p a pie@@ ce of un@@ agi on the flo@@ or and upon re@@ tri@@ eving it from the flo@@ or proce@@ ed to use the pie@@ ce in the deli@@ very order he was prepar@@ ing .
no thanks ! ! !
" this place , which is only a few months old , is perhaps que@@ ens ' bi@@ gg@@ est secret ! "
" fa@@ bul@@ ous dec@@ or - makes you feel like you 're in a tren@@ dy man@@ hat@@ tan restau@@ rant , very very good food , che@@ ap@@ ly@@ -@@ pri@@ ced , gener@@ ally fri@@ end@@ ly staff , and if you 're a man@@ hat@@ tan@@ ite , or spend most of your time in man@@ hat@@ tan , rice a@@ venue will make you feel at home .@@ .... very so@@ ho / village / up@@ per west side min@@ us the expen@@ sive prices and preten@@ ti@@ ous cli@@ ent@@ ele .@@ .... all on ro@@ ose@@ vel@@ t a@@ venue ! "
we were se@@ ated outside and the wa@@ iter spil@@ led red w@@ ine and hot tea on myself and my date .
we were then sho@@ o@@ ed in@@ side .
" one would think we 'd get an apo@@ lo@@ gy or compli@@ ment@@ ary drin@@ ks - instead , we got a sno@@ bby wa@@ iter wouldn 't even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us li@@ p when we asked him to do so . "
" we left , never to return . "
" with so many good restau@@ ran@@ ts on the u@@ ws , i don 't need over@@ pri@@ ced food , absur@@ dly arrogan@@ t wa@@ it-@@ staff who don 't recogni@@ ze they work at a glori@@ fied din@@ er , clu@@ m@@ sy service , and management that doesn 't care . "
i am rela@@ tively new to the area and tried pi@@ ck a b@@ gel on 2@@ nd and was dis@@ appointed with the service and i thought the food was over@@ ated and on the pri@@ ce@@ y side .
the food is okay and the prices here are medi@@ oc@@ re .
bal@@ u@@ chi 's has soli@@ d food and a nice dec@@ or at reas@@ onable prices .
the only problem is that the manag@@ er is a complete in@@ compet@@ ent .
he offer@@ s sub@@ par service and has no person@@ ality .
" in fact , it appe@@ ars he is going to go post@@ al at any moment . "
there is no excuse for such lou@@ sy service !
i have never before e@@ aten 40 pi@@ ec@@ es of rela@@ tively good ni@@ gi@@ ri .
you can do it here .
$ 20 for all you can eat su@@ shi cannot be be@@ aten .
" i went to ar@@ eo on a sun@@ day after@@ noon with four of my gir@@ l@@ friends , and spent three enjo@@ y@@ able hours there . "
" most of the ser@@ vers are very atten@@ tive , fri@@ end@@ ly and quite attra@@ ctive . "
" the vi@@ be is very rela@@ x@@ ed and co@@ zy , service was great and the food was excellent ! "
me and my girls will defin@@ it@@ ely go back .
food was good and the view of the new york city skil@@ ine was terri@@ fic even on a fog@@ gy ra@@ iny day like that of when i went .
i would high@@ ly recom@@ mand re@@ quest@@ ing a table by the win@@ dow .
although they do the ty@@ pi@@ cal what kind of water would you like questions the service was good and over@@ all very rela@@ x@@ ing to place to eat .
the food is great .
personal pan@@ s are the perfect size for those hun@@ gry ni@@ ghts .
i he@@ arti@@ ly recom@@ mend .
there is a dow@@ n@@ side if you 're or@@ dering in -- the deli@@ very gu@@ ys have major attitude .
never have i had such dramati@@ c deli@@ very gu@@ ys ( a lot of hu@@ ffing and pan@@ ting and mut@@ tering under bre@@ ath b / c i live in a wal@@ kup ) who always seem dis@@ appointed with their ti@@ ps .
" love the sc@@ ene first off@@ - the place has a char@@ ac@@ ter and nice light to it .. very fortun@@ ate , lo@@ cation wise . "
the pi@@ zza was pretty good and huge .
the price very reas@@ onable .
we were 4 and got the family size pen@@ ne a la vod@@ ka which was tre@@ men@@ dou@@ s@@ ly gigan@@ tic por@@ tion ... a bu@@ cket of food liter@@ ally .
i would say that all was fine and ta@@ sty but the he@@ av@@ in@@ ess on my stom@@ ach som@@ et@@ ing that i can 't not mention or under@@ mine .
" the pa@@ sta pen@@ ne was pretty extra but@@ ter@@ y , cre@@ amy which means a big task to dig@@ gest .. ta@@ sty at first but i would say that i was full with a sli@@ ce of pi@@ zza and 7 to coun@@ t , pen@@ ne ... got a little mo@@ ody after@@ wards cause was stu@@ ff@@ ed ... lo@@ l "
" la rosa wal@@ t@@ zes in , and i think they are doing it the best . "
" interesting selec@@ tion , good win@@ es , service fine , f@@ un dec@@ or . "
i love it .
i plan on stop@@ ping by next week as well .

i love this place !

" an aw@@ es@@ ome organ@@ ic dog , and a consci@@ ous e@@ co fri@@ end@@ ly establis@@ h@@ ment . "

i was visit@@ ing new york city with a friend and we dis@@ covered this really war@@ m and invit@@ ing restau@@ rant .
" i lo@@ oo@@ ve their eg@@ g@@ plant pi@@ zza , as well as their pa@@ stas ! "
" we had half / half pi@@ zza , mine was eg@@ g@@ plant and my friend had the bu@@ ff@@ alo and it was so@@ oo huge for a small size pi@@ zza ! "
" we had f@@ un e@@ ating in there , we were there like around 3 a.@@ m. in the morning ! "
" will com@@ eb@@ ac@@ k for sure , wish they have it here in la .. "
" excellent food , although the interior could use some help . "
" the space kind of fe@@ els like an alice in wonder@@ land set@@ ting , without it trying to be that . "
" i paid just about $ 60 for a good me@@ al , though : ) "
great sake !
" reli@@ able , fre@@ sh su@@ shi "

i 'd defin@@ it@@ ely go back again .

excellent food for great prices
my husband and i have been sol@@ d on this from the first visit .

" its just a f@@ un place to go , not a five star re@@ star@@ a@@ unt . "
way belo@@ w aver@@ age
i think the pi@@ zza is so over@@ rat@@ ed and was under co@@ o@@ ked .
had no fla@@ vor and the staff is ru@@ de and not atten@@ tive .
would never go back
i love this place
i wasn 't here for the pi@@ zza so i can 't comment on that yet but what i had was very good .
the service was qui@@ ck and fri@@ end@@ ly .
everyone was s@@ mil@@ ing so that made me feel welcome .
i thought the restau@@ rant was nice and clean .
i or@@ dered the vit@@ ello alla mar@@ sala and i was pretty im@@ pres@@ sed .
the ve@@ al and the mu@@ sh@@ ro@@ oms were co@@ o@@ ked perfec@@ tly .
the pot@@ ato b@@ alls were not dry at all ... in fact it was but@@ ter@@ y .
the only dow@@ n@@ side ... they only take cas@@ h which is ok if you know about it ahead of time .
i 'll be back for sure .

i was looking for ban@@ ana tem@@ pura for des@@ sert and they dont have .
" not because you are " " the four se@@ as@@ ons " ... " - you are allowed to charge an arm and a leg for a ro@@ mati@@ c din@@ ner . "
" the food was excellent as well as service , however , i left the four se@@ as@@ ons very dis@@ sap@@ pointed . "
i do not think din@@ ner in man@@ hat@@ tan should cost $ 4@@ 00@@ .00 where i am not swe@@ pt off my fe@@ et .
" red dra@@ gon roll - my favor@@ ite thing to eat , of any food group - hands down "
just go to yam@@ ato and order the red dra@@ gon roll .

" oh , and i never write re@@ vie@@ w@@ s-@@ -i just was so mo@@ ved by how bad this place was , i felt it was my duty to spre@@ ad the word . "
great indi@@ an food !

the best !
" great food , amaz@@ ing service , this place is a cla@@ ss act . "
the ve@@ al was incre@@ di@@ ble last night .
" fre@@ sh , mind blo@@ wing f@@ lavor@@ s . "
this place is a must visit !
" deli@@ ci@@ ous , cre@@ ative and f@@ un . "
got a date ? go here !
every time i have a special occasion with my boy@@ friend i have a hard time going any@@ where else .
it is so roman@@ tic .
" its dar@@ k , and co@@ zy .. there is always jaz@@ z music playing when we go . "
most of the bo@@ oth@@ s allow you to sit next to e@@ ach@@ other without looking like ' that ' couple .
the food is all shar@@ ed so we get to order together and eat together .
i 've enjo@@ yed 99 % of the dis@@ hes we 've or@@ dered with the only excep@@ tions being the occa@@ sional to@@ o-@@ auth@@ enti@@ c-@@ for@@ -me dis@@ h ( i 'm a dar@@ ing e@@ ater but not that dar@@ ing ) .
once you try it for a special occasion bew@@ are .. you can 't stop !
" you 'll be ther for every anniver@@ sary , bir@@ th@@ day , val@@ ent@@ ines day ... "
for a fa@@ bul@@ ous wed@@ ding !
my dau@@ ghter 's wed@@ ding recep@@ tion at water 's ed@@ ge received the high@@ est compli@@ ments from our gu@@ est@@ s .
everyone ra@@ ved about the at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here ( eleg@@ ant ro@@ oms and absolutely in@@ compar@@ able views ) and the fa@@ bul@@ ous food !
service was wonder@@ ful ;
everyone was ch@@ eer@@ fully cooper@@ ative and hel@@ p@@ ful .
" paul , the mait@@ re d ' , was tot@@ ally profession@@ al and always on top of things . "
thank you everyone at water 's ed@@ ge .
would not go back .
" service ok but un@@ fri@@ end@@ ly , fil@@ thy bat@@ h@@ room . "
the high prices you 're going to pay is for the view not for the food .
" the bar drin@@ ks were eh , ok to say the least . "
the stu@@ ff tila@@ pia was hor@@ rid ... ta@@ sted like car@@ d@@ board .
" we thought the des@@ sert would be better , wrong ! "
$ 17@@ 0 down the to@@ il@@ et ...
" oh speaking of bat@@ h@@ room , the mens bat@@ h@@ room was dis@@ gu@@ sting . "
" the flo@@ or was wet , the tra@@ sh can fil@@ led with hand to@@ wel@@ s n all over the flo@@ or , no so@@ ap , and no hand to@@ wel@@ s left . "
good experience
the w@@ ine list was exten@@ sive - though the staff did not seem knowled@@ ge@@ able about w@@ ine pa@@ ir@@ ings .
" the bre@@ ad we received was hor@@ ri@@ ble - rock hard and col@@ d - and the " " free " " ap@@ peti@@ zer of oli@@ ves was dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting . "
" however , our main course was wonder@@ ful . "
i had fish and my husband had the fil@@ et - both of which exce@@ eded our expecta@@ tions .
" the des@@ sert ( we had a pe@@ ar tor@@ te ) was good - but , once again , the staff was un@@ able to provide appropriate drink sug@@ gesti@@ ons . "
when we inqui@@ red about ports - the wa@@ it@@ re@@ ss li@@ sted off several but did not know taste vari@@ ations or cost .
not what i would expect for the price and pre@@ stige of this lo@@ cation .
" all in all , i would return - as it was a beautiful restau@@ rant - but i hope the staff pays more attention to the little details in the future . "
" short and s@@ weet - se@@ ating is great : it 's roman@@ tic , co@@ zy and private . "
the bo@@ ths are not as small as some of the re@@ views make them out to look they 're perfect for 2 people .
the service was extremely fast and atten@@ tive ( thanks to the service but@@ ton on your table ) but i bar@@ ely under@@ stood 1 word when the wa@@ iter took our order .
the food was ok and fair nothing to go c@@ razy .
over all the looks of the place exce@@ eds the actual me@@ als .
so what you really end up pay@@ ing for is the restau@@ rant not the food .
will prob@@ . not return but it is a great din@@ ning experience to try at@@ least once .
im@@ pres@@ sed ...
sub@@ tle food and service
nood@@ le pu@@ d@@ ding is exactly the type of service and food i enjo@@ y .
" ser@@ vers are all different , gre@@ g is my favor@@ ite . "
" sometimes ta@@ bles don 't understand his sense of hu@@ mor but it 's re@@ fre@@ sh@@ ing to have a ser@@ ver who has person@@ ality , profession@@ alism , and respec@@ ts the priva@@ cy of your din@@ ner . "
this is the first place i 've been that a run@@ ner re@@ members my order ... hope he lik@@ es his job because i have half a mind to ste@@ al him for my restau@@ rant .
prices are fair across the board for both food and be@@ v .
" i go out to eat and like my cour@@ ses , ser@@ vers are patient and never ru@@ sh cour@@ ses or force another drink . "
amaz@@ ing fre@@ sh do@@ gs but best of all end@@ less topp@@ ings ! ! !
this place had all the tri@@ m@@ m@@ ings and i mean all .
" pe@@ p@@ pers , oni@@ ons , re@@ lis@@ h , chil@@ li , che@@ eses , you name it . "
amaz@@ ing f@@ un for hot dog lo@@ vers of all ages please do yourself a favor and check this place out ! ! ! !
best din@@ ing experience in the west village !
step@@ ping into casa la femme last night was a true experience un@@ like any other in new york !
high@@ ly im@@ pres@@ sed from the dec@@ or to the food to the hospit@@ ality to the great night i had !
the have a great co@@ ck@@ ta@@ il with cit@@ rus vod@@ ka and lem@@ on and li@@ me ju@@ ice and mint leav@@ es that is to die for !
" food took some time to prepar@@ e , all worth waiting for . "
we were dra@@ wn into the bell@@ y dan@@ cing show that cap@@ tiv@@ ated the cro@@ wd .
i never write on these sites but this restau@@ rant is de@@ f worth commen@@ ding !
great find in the west village !
mag@@ got in the food !
" the menu looked great , and the wa@@ iter was very nice , but when the food came , it was aver@@ age . "
" nevertheless , i fin@@ ished my pl@@ ate , and that 's when i found a mag@@ got in mu@@ sh@@ room sau@@ ce at the bot@@ tom . "
" i sho@@ wed it to the manag@@ er , and he s@@ mil@@ ingly apo@@ logi@@ zed and brought us two free des@@ ser@@ ts ( but did not ask us what we wanted and so brought the last two des@@ ser@@ ts we would have asked for ) . "
" when the bill came , nothing was com@@ ped , so i told the manag@@ er very polit@@ ely that we were wil@@ ling to pay for the w@@ ine , but i didn 't think i should have to pay for food with a mag@@ got in it . "
" the manag@@ er finally said he would com@@ p the two gla@@ sses of w@@ ine ( which cost less than the food ) , and made it seem like a big conces@@ sion . "
we paid and left because we didn 't feel like argu@@ ing any more .
" i have worked in restau@@ ran@@ ts and co@@ ok a lot , and there is no way a mag@@ got should be able to get into well prepared food . "
" for a restau@@ rant with such a good repu@@ tation and that is usu@@ ally so pac@@ ked , there was no reason for such a lack of intellig@@ ent cu@@ stom@@ er service . "
un@@ hy@@ gi@@ eni@@ c
i do not recom@@ mend .
i got ha@@ ir in my food 2 times of then !
" great place , great value . "
" the food is f@@ lavor@@ ful , pl@@ enti@@ ful and reas@@ on@@ ably pri@@ ced . "
the at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here is rela@@ x@@ ed and ca@@ su@@ al .
it 's a great place to order from or sit@@ -@@ in .
aw@@ es@@ ome
" in@@ expen@@ sive , un@@ as@@ sum@@ ing , great time ! "
su@@ shi experience was un@@ beli@@ eva@@ ble with my fi@@ ance .
try it !
very pleased
good cre@@ ative ro@@ lls !
" yam@@ ato is an excellent place to go if you@@ re not into sa@@ sh@@ imi , or if you have friends who does@@ nt like su@@ shi much . "
" they have great ro@@ lls , the tri@@ ple col@@ or and nor@@ weg@@ etan ro@@ lls , are aw@@ es@@ ome and fil@@ ling . "
" one special roll and one regular roll is enough to fil@@ l you up , but save room for des@@ sert ! "
" they have a deli@@ ci@@ ous ban@@ ana cho@@ col@@ ate des@@ sert , as well as a great green tea tem@@ pura . "
the ap@@ peti@@ z@@ ers are also deli@@ ci@@ ous !
amaz@@ ing food .
maz@@ ing interior .
great food !
i 've had my fair share of modern japan@@ ese and this spo@@ t deli@@ vers .
" the at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here was pretty nice but had a bit la@@ cking , which it tries to make up for with a c@@ razy sch@@ eme of mir@@ r@@ ors . "
" if you 're into being lost when you 're just five fe@@ et from your table then hey , that 's a good thing . "
despite the confu@@ sing mir@@ r@@ ors this will likely be my go@@ -to for modern japan@@ ese food for the fores@@ ee@@ able future .
" indo chinese food , pretty good ... "
not a very fan@@ cy place but very good chinese sty@@ le indi@@ an food .
" the chi@@ cken lol@@ li@@ pop is my favor@@ ite , most of the dis@@ hes ( i have to agree with a previous re@@ vie@@ wer ) are quite o@@ ily and very spi@@ cy , espe@@ ic@@ ally the chil@@ li chi@@ cken . "
" my mom origin@@ ally introdu@@ ced me to this place , but even she ( being indi@@ an ) fe@@ els the food can be some@@ what over the top spi@@ cy and far too o@@ ily . "
still we keep going back : )
i was spe@@ ech@@ less by the hor@@ ri@@ ble food .
" i atten@@ ded a holi@@ day din@@ ner at the restau@@ rant , and the food was major@@ ly dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting . "
" rather than prepar@@ ing veget@@ arian dis@@ h , the chef presented me with a pl@@ ate of ste@@ am@@ ed veget@@ ables ( min@@ us sau@@ ce , se@@ as@@ on@@ ing , or any form or a@@ est@@ he@@ tic present@@ ation ) . "
" i was so stun@@ ned , and i left the din@@ ner hun@@ gry and major@@ ly dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting . "
this place sur@@ vi@@ ves on repu@@ tation alone .
i will never return .
best in all of ny@@ c
" this is the most wonder@@ ful restau@@ rant in all of new york city , not just bro@@ ok@@ ly@@ n ... "
" for 7 years they have put out the most ta@@ sty , most deli@@ ci@@ ous food and kept it that way ... "
" never s@@ wa@@ ying , never a bad me@@ al , never bad service ... "
you should travel from the bron@@ x to try it ...
" great food , great w@@ ine list , great service in a great neigh@@ bor@@ hood ... "
so deli@@ ci@@ ous ! ! ! ! ! !
pat@@ sy 's pi@@ zza = true love
hands down the best pi@@ zza on the planet .
" in about 12 minutes , the thing is gone . "
great hot do@@ gs ..
the hot do@@ gs were jui@@ cy and ten@@ der in@@ side and had pl@@ ent@@ y of c@@ run@@ ch and sna@@ p on the outside .
great topp@@ ings defin@@ it@@ ely a place you need to check out for late night mun@@ chi@@ es or a mid day bo@@ ost !
great taste
" great , original taste . "
" for me dis@@ hes a little o@@ ily , but over@@ all din@@ ing experience good . "
hel@@ p@@ ful service and aver@@ age price per dis@@ h $ 10 .
the only thing that stri@@ kes you is the dec@@ or ? ( not very ple@@ as@@ ant ) .
great food
this place has great indi@@ an chinese food .
the f@@ lavor@@ s are amaz@@ ing and the value is p@@ hen@@ omen@@ al .
" be prepared to wait , because the place is pretty tin@@ y . "
" also , they do not take cre@@ dit card so come with cas@@ h ! "
" even though the place is not beautiful , the food spe@@ aks for itself . "
" best indi@@ an chinese in the city , by far ! "
amaz@@ ing my favor@@ ite ! ! !
" i came across village under@@ ground by accident , now i go there all the time . "
the mar@@ tin@@ is are amaz@@ ing and very fair@@ ly pri@@ ced .
" the service is amaz@@ ing , i 've had different wa@@ it@@ ers and they were all nice , which is a rare thing in ny@@ c . "
" the d@@ j is aw@@ es@@ ome , i have been there for my bir@@ th@@ day and a bun@@ ch of other times with friends and i keep going back . "
you can get a table without a reserva@@ tion if you get there early i they don 't make you by bo@@ tt@@ les .
which let@@ s face it .... at times it 's a good thing .
in the end you end up with a fair tab and nothing but a great time ! ! !
high@@ ly recom@@ men@@ ded !
" one of the best , if not the best , restau@@ ran@@ ts in park slo@@ pe ( and ny in general ) "
everything on the menu is great .
this establis@@ h@@ ment is the real deal .
" wish ny had more of these kind of places : in@@ tim@@ ate , super@@ b food , hom@@ ey , top not@@ ch all the way around , certainly worth the wait . "
but $ 500 for a din@@ ner for two that didn 't include w@@ ine ?
" look , the ap@@ peti@@ z@@ ers were really good . "
the entre@@ e was also very good .
" can 't ar@@ gue about that , but they are clearly over pri@@ ced . "
what you are pay@@ ing for is the environment and the name .
" yes , the place is cla@@ ss@@ y and beautiful , but they most certainly tar@@ get the u@@ ber whe@@ al@@ thy not the common joe that wants to go all out every once in a while . "
which of course is not real ko@@ be but wa@@ gy@@ u be@@ ef .
sur@@ pris@@ ed that a place of this cali@@ ber would ad@@ verti@@ se it as ko@@ be .
van@@ ison was good but not amaz@@ ing .
bis@@ on was quite excellent however .
des@@ sert : pure disast@@ er .
just not good at all .
some pin@@ e@@ ap@@ ple covered in a gla@@ ze of some kind and some pe@@ ar tar@@ t thing not impressi@@ ve at all .
" i read re@@ views that called the restau@@ rant too expen@@ sive and i thought to myself , but may be it is worth it . "
" the four se@@ as@@ ons has history and it is a sort of land@@ mark of new york city restau@@ ran@@ ts , but trust me , they will charge you through the no@@ se just so that you can say " " i 've been to the four se@@ as@@ ons restau@@ rant " . " "
" i wanted to go there to see if it was worth it and sa@@ dly , curi@@ ou@@ sity got the best of me and i paid de@@ ar@@ ly for it . "
" all in all , the food was great ( except for the dess@@ ser@@ ts ) . "
the environment is very up@@ sc@@ ale and you will see a lot of rich gu@@ ys with tro@@ phy wi@@ ves or just high@@ ly paid es@@ cor@@ ts .
" if you are going for the food , it will not be worth it . "
" you would think they would make up for it with service , sa@@ dly , no . "
" service was just ok , it is not what you 'd expect for $ 500 . "
terrible waste of money .. s@@ cam@@ mers
i agree that din@@ ing at casa la femme is like no other din@@ ing experience !
i am actually offen@@ ded to have spent so much money on such a bad experience .
i liter@@ ally just got back home after visit@@ ing casa la femme and was so offen@@ ded by my visit felt it necessary to try and war@@ n other din@@ ers who value their money and time .
" our visit their to say the least , was an un@@ ple@@ as@@ ant and co@@ stly experience ! "
and even more so un@@ ple@@ as@@ ant because it was so co@@ stly for such an un@@ ple@@ as@@ ant experience .
we did arrive late for our reserva@@ tion so i can not compla@@ in too much about the wait for a table .
although we were told 10-@@ 15 minutes and it was more like 45 minutes .
we were ush@@ er@@ ed to the bar to wait moment@@ ar@@ ily and upon arri@@ val were so ex@@ cit@@ ed .
the place is beautiful !
the ho@@ st@@ ess was very ple@@ as@@ ant .
" however , our $ 14 drin@@ ks were were hor@@ ri@@ ble ! "
" once we finally got a table , despite indicat@@ ing we wanted an alla carte menu we were pus@@ hed into a table that was only price fix@@ ed ! "
our experience did not ever get any better .
for each course we wa@@ it@@ ed over 1 / 2 hour to 45 minutes and were never offer@@ ed a drink .
we also asked for ho@@ oka six times and the wa@@ iter kept tell@@ ing us one minute and never re@@ turning with the ho@@ oka .
after the 4@@ th time i asked again and the wa@@ iter than said after our din@@ ner .
we asked for be@@ ver@@ ages and never received them .
we asked for sides which the wa@@ iter than ad@@ mitted that he for@@ got to put in that part of our order .
my chi@@ cken was in@@ edi@@ ble as there were so many fat@@ ty lum@@ ps which i had to keep spit@@ ting out into my nap@@ kin .
i would not expect this for a $ 55 din@@ ner .
by the time we fin@@ ished our din@@ ner we still had not received one be@@ ver@@ age nor ho@@ oka !
what we did do was waste 3 hours being tra@@ pped in a table waiting and waiting for food and drin@@ ks and ho@@ oka .. some of which we never received !
the only be@@ ver@@ age we did receive was water in dir@@ ty gla@@ sses !
to top it all off .. the main reason we came to your restau@@ rant was for the bell@@ y dan@@ cer@@ s and mis@@ sed the first show as we were not se@@ ated yet and the 2@@ nd bell@@ y dan@@ cer only dan@@ ced at two ta@@ bles in the back of the restau@@ rant and never made it around to the other half of the restau@@ rant .
" by the time we left our wall@@ ets were emp@@ y and so were our stom@@ ach@@ s and we mis@@ sed the show we were sup@@ posed to see following our din@@ ner , which would have been acceptable if we got to enjo@@ y the experience of good food and bell@@ y dan@@ cer@@ s ! "
if it se@@ em@@ ed possible to do so while there i would have fou@@ ght my bill since my din@@ ner por@@ tion of my me@@ al was in@@ edi@@ ble !
" i have never left a restau@@ rant fe@@ eling as if i was abu@@ sed , and wa@@ sted my hard ear@@ ned money . "
my hus@@ band@@ s bir@@ th@@ day and my sons was not as it was inten@@ ded ... and we dro@@ ve two hours to spend too much money to be tre@@ ated terri@@ bly !
i wish i could be re@@ fun@@ ded !
don 't go with a lar@@ ger group than 4 !
" at first we were a little taken ab@@ ac@@ k , as this se@@ em@@ ed to present a problem , although the restau@@ rant looked fair@@ ly emp@@ ty , but they ha@@ stil@@ y put the table together for us . "
the menu is fair@@ ly simple without much descri@@ p@@ tions .
" there was no ta@@ p be@@ er that evening , which was a dis@@ appo@@ int@@ ment . "
" not much of a selec@@ tion of bo@@ tt@@ led be@@ er either , we went with bra@@ h@@ ma . "
the ap@@ peti@@ z@@ ers we or@@ dered were ser@@ ved quickly - an order of fri@@ ed oy@@ sters and clam@@ s were deli@@ ci@@ ous but a tin@@ y por@@ tion ( maybe 3 of each ) .
" the lob@@ ster knu@@ ck@@ les ( special of the day ) were ok , but pretty ta@@ stel@@ ess . "
" i believe there were 2 sh@@ rim@@ p in the " " sal@@ t en@@ cru@@ sted sh@@ rim@@ p " " ap@@ peti@@ zer . "
" she repli@@ ed " " well it would be more conven@@ ient for us if you or@@ dered now , since you are a lar@@ ger party , and it might get crow@@ ded . " " "
the food arri@@ ved in about 15 minutes .
i had the th@@ ai sty@@ le fri@@ ed sea bas@@ s ... which was very good .
" everyone se@@ em@@ ed gener@@ ally happy with their food , except my brother who had the gri@@ l@@ led mah@@ i mah@@ i , se@@ em@@ ingly dren@@ ched in grap@@ fruit ju@@ ice ! "
i heard the lob@@ ster roll was excellent .
" they se@@ em@@ ed to continue to ru@@ sh us along , taking plat@@ es without asking if we were done ( my sister still had her for@@ k in hand ) . "
" all in all the food was good - a little on the expen@@ sive side , but fre@@ sh . "
" service not the fri@@ end@@ li@@ est to our " " large party " " ! "
probably would not go back here .
great indi@@ an food
" food was amaz@@ ing - i love indi@@ an food and eat it quite regular@@ ly , but i can say this is one of the best i 've had . "
" very " " normal indi@@ an food " , " but done really well . "
" i have it a 4 instead of 5 because of the price ( just chi@@ cken tik@@ ka ma@@ sala - no bre@@ ad of rice - is $ 25 ) , which i would expect at a up@@ sc@@ ale indi@@ an restau@@ rant but this place doesn 't have an up@@ sc@@ ale feel . "
" also , wa@@ it@@ ers try to pu@@ sh more food on you , like sug@@ gest things as if they are compli@@ ment@@ ary when they actually cost $ . "
i don 't appreci@@ ate places or people that try to drive up the bill without the pat@@ ron 's knowledge so that was a huge tur@@ no@@ ff ( more than the price ) .
" but if you 're prepared to spend some $ and remember to ask if something they offer is compli@@ ment@@ ary , then this is the place to go for indi@@ an food "
one of the best
" bu@@ k@@ hara gri@@ ll , the ta@@ gl@@ ine says it all .. " " indi@@ an spi@@ ce ra@@ ve " " "
the lun@@ ch bu@@ ffet is expen@@ sive but is de@@ ff worth it .
we have gone for din@@ ner only a few times but the same great quality and service is given .
bu@@ k@@ hara is on my top 5 indi@@ an places in ny@@ c
w@@ ret@@ ched and ret@@ ching
i have never been so dis@@ gu@@ sted by both food an service .
for star@@ ters they deli@@ ver@@ ed us someone else 's order .
" however , once i received my pre@@ dic@@ tab@@ ly medi@@ oc@@ re order of what do@@ ke@@ bi thin@@ ks pass@@ es as kor@@ ean fair , ( sometimes you have to set@@ tle when it 's your only op@@ tion ) , i got through about half my kim@@ ch@@ ee before i found a pie@@ ce of ran@@ dom let@@ tu@@ ce ac@@ compan@@ i@@ ed by a far more dis@@ gu@@ sting , sli@@ my , clearly bad pie@@ ce of fish skin . "
" my main concern was the san@@ ity of the food that was being sent out to myself and others , but i would be ly@@ ing is i said that as someone who has worked in restau@@ ran@@ ts since the age of fif@@ teen i was expe@@ cting at least a min@@ ima@@ l effort on the part of the restau@@ rant to am@@ end the situation . "
none was made so i hung up .
less than three minutes passed before i found myself dou@@ bled over the to@@ il@@ et .
" my gir@@ l@@ friend , being sli@@ gh@@ tly more aggre@@ ssi@@ ve , and having been equ@@ ally dis@@ gu@@ sted caus@@ ing her to th@@ row out the re@@ main@@ der of her bar@@ ely e@@ aten me@@ al , called back only to be infor@@ med that i was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oy@@ ster , and that we were also bla@@ ck@@ li@@ sted from their restau@@ rant . "
" it wasn 't as if this restau@@ rant had any major bra@@ g@@ ging points before hand , but now it 's simply re@@ pul@@ sive . "
eat at your own risk .
gor@@ ge@@ ous place ide@@ al for a roman@@ tic din@@ ner
i book a gor@@ ge@@ ous white organ@@ za tent which included a four course prix fi@@ x menu which we enjo@@ yed a lot .
the service was spe@@ cta@@ cu@@ lar as the wa@@ iter knew everything about the menu and his recommenda@@ tions were amaz@@ ing !
i completely recom@@ mend casa la femme for any special occasion and to really impre@@ ss your date .
more william@@ s@@ burg gar@@ ba@@ ge
the dis@@ hes came out around 5 minutes apart .
" the bi@@ bi@@ mba@@ p was aver@@ age , but the stone bow@@ l wasn 't even close to siz@@ z@@ ling . "
too bad i had paid an extra $ 2 for the stone bow@@ l .
the nak@@ gi@@ -@@ bo@@ kum was hor@@ ri@@ ble .
easi@@ ly the wor@@ st sti@@ r-@@ fri@@ ed squ@@ id i 've ever ta@@ sted .
the sau@@ ce ta@@ sted more like chinese fast food than dec@@ ent kor@@ ean .
" the side dis@@ hes were passa@@ ble , and i did get a re@@ fil@@ l upon request . "
the real problem i had with this place was the complete lack of service .
she just no@@ d@@ ded and wal@@ ked off .
" as to my comment about the food , no apo@@ lo@@ gy or ac@@ knowled@@ g@@ ment was made . "
my wife had bar@@ ely tou@@ ched that mes@@ s of a dis@@ h .
we were char@@ ged full price .
lives up to the hy@@ pe
we 've tried before but it always pac@@ ked and doesn 't take reserva@@ tions .
it was well worth the wait .
the wife had the ris@@ otto which was amaz@@ ing .
" it doesn 't look ap@@ peti@@ zing as it 's covered in squ@@ id ink and it tur@@ ns your li@@ ps and te@@ eth black , but the taste was p@@ hen@@ omen@@ al . "
the far@@ ro sala@@ d and the mas@@ hed y@@ uk@@ on po@@ tat@@ o@@ es were also extremely ta@@ sty .

possi@@ bly the most roman@@ tic restau@@ rant in the city
" this is und@@ ou@@ b@@ te@@ dly my favor@@ ite modern japan@@ ese bra@@ s@@ serie ( that don 't serve su@@ shi ) , and in my opinion , one of the most roman@@ tic restau@@ ran@@ ts in the city ! "
" not only is it an ad@@ vent@@ ure getting to this some@@ what hid@@ den spo@@ t , once you enter the un@@ marked wo@@ o@@ den do@@ ors , the zen and in@@ tim@@ ate déc@@ or will make you feel like you 're no longer in the city . "
" if you 're planning to come here , make sure that your date is someone whom you really like since you 'll be ush@@ er@@ ed to private bo@@ oth@@ s where there will be no people or food wat@@ ching ( cho@@ ose the ones on the ground level that have gla@@ ss ce@@ il@@ ings so you may see the star@@ s in the sky ! ) . "
it 's just you and your date and an occa@@ sional cu@@ te " excuse me " before the wa@@ iter op@@ ens the little cur@@ tain to your bo@@ ot@@ h !
" my party had the bbe $ 29 fi@@ xe prix menu , which was such a wonder@@ ful deal since it also came with a fli@@ ght of sake ! "
we started off with a deli@@ gh@@ t@@ ful sa@@ sh@@ imi am@@ use bou@@ che .
" i pic@@ ked the gri@@ l@@ led black co@@ d as my entre@@ e , which i absolutely de@@ vou@@ red while someone comment@@ ed that the gri@@ l@@ led sal@@ mon dis@@ h was better . "
the sake 's compli@@ ment@@ ed the cour@@ ses very well and is success@@ fully eas@@ ing me into the sake world .
" for des@@ ser@@ ts , we tried the fro@@ zen black ses@@ ame mou@@ sse ( interesting but not extraordin@@ ary ) and mat@@ cha ( pow@@ dered green tea ) and blu@@ e@@ ber@@ ry che@@ es@@ ec@@ ake , which was p@@ hen@@ omen@@ al . "
" maybe it was the great company ( i had friends visit@@ ing from ph@@ il@@ ly - yes , it was not a date this time ) or the super reas@@ onable price point , but i just can 't say enough good things about this bra@@ s@@ serie . "
" i don 't usu@@ ally visit the same establis@@ h@@ ment more than once , what more twi@@ ce , but i 'll come to zen@@ ki@@ chi any@@ time for a qui@@ et , un@@ hur@@ ried and memor@@ able din@@ ner . "
terrible would be a compli@@ ment !
" the service leav@@ es much to be desi@@ red , from fe@@ eling like you are rus@@ hed the place your order , to being ignor@@ ed the rest of the night . "
we paid a fix@@ ed pri@@ c@@ ce but got nothing ! !
we never ate because by close to 2 in the mon@@ ring we were not ser@@ ved and were too up@@ set ad ti@@ red to start e@@ ating .
" they are extremely ru@@ de , not even apo@@ logi@@ zing for the hor@@ ri@@ ble service we got and hand@@ ing us a bill well over $ 500 for some drin@@ ks ad@@ n their p@@ ita bre@@ ad ! "
stay away
great sha@@ bu sha@@ bu

i tried a couple other dis@@ hes but wasn 't too im@@ pres@@ sed .

restau@@ rant with a view
the food ta@@ sted very good .
the family se@@ af@@ o@@ od entre@@ e was very good .
the main entre@@ e was also very good .
" price is high but the food is good , so i would come back again . "
this place doesn 't make any sense
just want to war@@ n you all - don 't waste your time and money .
" this place has tot@@ ally wei@@ r@@ d dec@@ or , sta@@ irs going up with mir@@ r@@ or@@ ed w@@ alls - i am sur@@ pris@@ ed how no one yet bro@@ ke their head or fall off the sta@@ irs - mir@@ r@@ or@@ ed w@@ alls make you diz@@ zy and delu@@ sional ... "
this place is not invit@@ ing and the food is tot@@ ally wei@@ r@@ d .
the concept of japan@@ ese ta@@ pas is new@@ ly created and clearly doesn 't work .
" the food they serve is not com@@ for@@ ting , not ap@@ peti@@ zing and un@@ co@@ o@@ ked . "
good food
" the food was great and ta@@ sty , but the sitting space was too small , i don 't like being c@@ ram@@ p in a cor@@ ner . "
over all it was a very nice roman@@ tic place .
lo@@ ved it
a co@@ wor@@ ker and i tried paci@@ fico after work a few fri@@ days and lo@@ ved it .
the at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here was great .
" the food we or@@ dered was excellent , although i wouldn 't say the margar@@ itas were anything to write home about . "
" our wa@@ it@@ re@@ ss wasn 't mean , but not especially war@@ m or atten@@ tive either . "
" i must say i am sur@@ pris@@ ed by the bad re@@ views of the restau@@ rant earlier in the year , though . "
" regar@@ d@@ less , we 'll be back and can 't wait to visit in the sum@@ mer to take advan@@ tage of the pati@@ o . "
du@@ mb@@ fo@@ und@@ ingly poor
" this was , from start to fin@@ ish , a min@@ d-@@ bog@@ gl@@ ingly un@@ com@@ for@@ table experience . "
le@@ xi@@ co@@ grap@@ hers take note : a new and fas@@ cin@@ ating definition of ru@@ den@@ ess is ali@@ ve and f@@ lou@@ ris@@ hing right here in bro@@ ok@@ ly@@ n .
the ser@@ vers at f@@ lat@@ bush far@@ m appear to have perfec@@ ted that g@@ ha@@ stly techni@@ que of making you feel guil@@ ty and as@@ ham@@ ed for de@@ ign@@ ing to attra@@ ct their attention .
polit@@ e ac@@ knowled@@ gement is out ;

" and how many times can you pi@@ ck up the same perfec@@ tly ali@@ g@@ ned set of nap@@ kins , inspe@@ ct them va@@ pi@@ dly and pl@@ on@@ k them down in exactly the same place instead of vent@@ ur@@ ing a g@@ lance at people who are there to help you make the rent ? "
" a different ser@@ ver en@@ han@@ ced the f@@ un , dumping our entre@@ es in front of us hal@@ f@@ way through our ap@@ peti@@ zer ( which was deli@@ ci@@ ous ) . "
" over@@ all the food quality was pretty good , though i hear the sal@@ mon is much better when it has@@ n 't sat co@@ ol@@ ing in front of the gu@@ est . "
" the place has a nice fit@@ -@@ out , some attra@@ ctive fur@@ nis@@ h@@ ings and , from what i could tell , a reas@@ onable w@@ ine list ( i was given the food menu when i asked for the carte des vin@@ s ) "
" at $ 120 for two people , however , this in no way represent@@ s value , unless you 're looking to pay by the hour for passi@@ ve-@@ aggre@@ ssi@@ ve tor@@ ture . "
" on that sc@@ ale , it 's a wor@@ ld@@ -be@@ ater . "
how is this pal@@ ce still open ?
i hon@@ est@@ ly don 't even know where to begin .
" we arri@@ ved and were se@@ ated immediately , which made us both happy . "
everything was going good until we got our me@@ als .
i took one look at the chi@@ cken and i was ap@@ pal@@ led .
" it was ser@@ ved with skin , over a bed of extremely under@@ co@@ o@@ ked sp@@ in@@ ach and mas@@ hed po@@ tat@@ o@@ es . "
" i took one b@@ ite from the $ 24 sal@@ mon , and i have never , in the 17 years i have been going to restau@@ ran@@ ts ta@@ sted sal@@ mon as fis@@ hy , as dry , and as bland as the one in f@@ lat@@ bush far@@ ms . "
" at this point , the wa@@ it@@ re@@ ss comes over and ask@@ s us if everything was okay , i was liter@@ ally so sho@@ cked that i was spe@@ ech@@ less and didn 't say anything , and guess what , the wa@@ it@@ re@@ ss wal@@ ked away . "
" so , i s@@ wit@@ ch with my boy@@ friend again to see if maybe i could stom@@ ach the me@@ at and sp@@ in@@ ach again , but the sp@@ in@@ ach was so under@@ co@@ o@@ ked that i just could not b@@ ite through it . "
i couldn 't even enjo@@ y the mas@@ hed po@@ tat@@ o@@ es because it was hid@@ den completely under the chi@@ cken and sp@@ in@@ ach .
so i decide to report back to the wa@@ it@@ re@@ ss because it was completely in@@ edi@@ ble .
" guess what , i wa@@ it@@ ed for tw@@ ent@@ y minutes before she came over and when she finally did , she says , " " oh well , i wish you would have said something earlier " " no apo@@ lo@@ gy , nothing . "
" after that she simply took our plat@@ es , wal@@ ked away , came back another tw@@ ent@@ y minutes later with the bill and the chi@@ cken on it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! "
" no deser@@ t menu , no apo@@ lo@@ gy , nothing ! ! ! ! ! ! "
" this is where it really really gets bad : the manag@@ er said , there is absolutely nothing we can do , it 's a matter of taste that she didn 't like it , and i cannot com@@ p it . "
" again , no apo@@ lo@@ gy , no is there anything else i can get you , no can i get you a drink to make up for it , nothing ! ! ! ! "
the level of ru@@ den@@ ess was pre@@ po@@ ster@@ ous .
" the manag@@ er came to the table and said we can do what we want , so we paid for what we did enjo@@ y , the drin@@ ks and ap@@ peti@@ z@@ ers , and wal@@ ked out . "
i have never ever had such an un@@ ple@@ as@@ ant experience .
this staff should be fi@@ red .
cir@@ sp@@ y cru@@ st mar@@ g@@ her@@ ita pi@@ zza
it was really good pi@@ zza .
the cru@@ st was ima@@ z@@ ingly co@@ o@@ ked well and pi@@ zza was fully lo@@ ade@@ d : ) : ) : )
you know what i mean all the posi@@ tives things happen@@ ing there made m@@ w write this review .
single wor@@ st restau@@ rant in man@@ hat@@ tan
" i 'll being with a couple of posi@@ tives : co@@ ol dec@@ or , good p@@ ita and hum@@ mus , and gri@@ l@@ led octo@@ pus that was actually pretty ta@@ sty . "
if i could give 0 star@@ s i would do so for this place .
the reason there are 4 different results on cit@@ y@@ search for the same place is because they keep trying to start a new thre@@ ad so they can stock it with positive re@@ views .
well ... they can run but they can 't hi@@ de .
this place ... god where do i begin .
it is quite a spe@@ cta@@ cu@@ lar sc@@ ene i 'll give them that .
the dec@@ or however seems to be the di@@ stra@@ ction so you won 't noti@@ ce that you just pay@@ ed 300 bu@@ cks for some col@@ d eg@@ g@@ plant that took 2 fri@@ ck@@ in hours to come ! ! ! !
" how this place sur@@ vi@@ ves the competi@@ tive west village market in this economy , or any other for that matter , is beyond me . "
great hot do@@ gs !
" though it 's been crow@@ ded most times i 've gone here , bar@@ k always deli@@ vers on their food . "
" the hot do@@ gs are top not@@ ch , and they 're s@@ lam@@ wi@@ ch is amaz@@ ing ! "
" going to bar@@ k is always worth the train ri@@ de , and will make your ton@@ gue and bell@@ y very happy ! "
only compla@@ int is the pri@@ c@@ ing-@@ -i believe it would be more reas@@ onable to pay a dollar less on each item li@@ sted on the menu .
" but non@@ eth@@ el@@ es@@ s-@@ -@@ great spo@@ t , great food . "
fa@@ bul@@ ous food - if the front of house staff don 't put you off -
" it 's a little out of our price ran@@ ge for din@@ ing there except on special occa@@ sions , but we 've e@@ aten there 6 times in the last 2 years . "
" each time we 've been , the front of house staff ( not the wa@@ it@@ ers - they 're fanta@@ stic - but the people who gre@@ et and se@@ at you ) has been so hi@@ de@@ ous to us that were it not for the excep@@ tional fish dis@@ hes i would never return . "
" as b@@ f@@ c doesn 't take reserva@@ tions you almost always have to wait by the bar - and be abu@@ sed by the front of house staff until you are se@@ ated , which can be over an hour later ! "
the fri@@ z@@ zy re@@ tro girl ( with win@@ ged / dame ed@@ na gla@@ sses ) will y@@ ell at you if you try to order a drink .
" i was almost am@@ used by the fact that she was turning away cu@@ stom@@ ers at 9@@ p@@ m on a fri@@ day night because she " " had a bb@@ q to go to " " that night - w@@ t@@ f ? ? "
i 'd be hor@@ ri@@ fied if my staff were turning away cu@@ stom@@ ers so early and so ru@@ del@@ y !
" there 's another girl who i can 't descri@@ be , she is about 5 ' 6 " " with brown ha@@ ir , who e@@ av@@ es@@ d@@ rop@@ s on your conver@@ sation and ch@@ im@@ es in - except she only he@@ ars the last part of what you said , so her un@@ invit@@ ed opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you 're * really * talking about . "
" i 'm a fri@@ end@@ ly person , so i wouldn 't mind had she not been so nast@@ y and go@@ tten so personal . "
" again , i 'd be super up@@ set if that were my emplo@@ ye@@ e . "
" consider@@ ing you will spend at least $ 60 a head , i expect better service . "
" so , if you 're wal@@ king by and thinking about din@@ ing , you might want to see who 's going to be se@@ ating you first ... "
" mait@@ re-@@ d@@ - " " eat and get out " " "
" the food and service were fine , however the mait@@ re-@@ d was incre@@ di@@ bly un@@ wel@@ coming and arrogan@@ t . "
" while fin@@ ish@@ ing our me@@ als which included a high@@ -@@ end bo@@ tt@@ le of w@@ ine , our son 's fi@@ ance jo@@ ined us for a gla@@ ss of w@@ ine and des@@ sert . "
" this guy refu@@ sed to se@@ at her and she left , followed shor@@ tly by the four of us , but not before i told him that in my 40 years of world travel , including paris , that i had never seen such a dis@@ play of bad beha@@ vi@@ or by a front@@ man in a restau@@ rant . "
" his response was smu@@ g , arrogan@@ t , and con@@ descen@@ ding , tot@@ ally consist@@ ent with his de@@ port@@ ment on dis@@ play all evening . "
" a word to the wise : you can 't dine here and dist@@ ur@@ b the mait@@ re-@@ d 's sense of " " table tur@@ no@@ ver " , " as w@@ ha@@ cked as it is , or else . "
" if you go here , do it on his off@@ -@@ night . "
best me@@ al in a long time !
mu@@ ss@@ les and cal@@ am@@ ari were super@@ b sat@@ ur@@ day evening .
i had the lam@@ b special which was perfect .
" my father had the flan@@ k ste@@ ak which was very good , and my mother had the s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish . "
the four se@@ as@@ ons restau@@ rant is a great experience .
the food is great and the environment is even better .
everyone must come here at least once .
high@@ ly recom@@ mend it !
taking hot do@@ gs to the next level
" at first g@@ lance this place seems a bit pri@@ ce@@ y for a hot dog joint , but at bar@@ k you don 't just get your aver@@ age hot dog . "
here the hot dog is elev@@ ated to the level of a real entre@@ e with numer@@ ous vari@@ ations available .
great at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here
" i high@@ ly recom@@ mend the fish ta@@ cos , everything else was ok . "
" co@@ ol at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here , the fire place in the back really ads to it but needs a bit more he@@ at throughout on a col@@ d night . "
poor service and management
don 't go to this place !
had an aw@@ ful experience at casa la femme on a sat@@ ur@@ day din@@ ner .
ap@@ peti@@ z@@ ers took near@@ ly an hour .
when the main course finally arri@@ ved ( another 4@@ 5@@ min@@ s ) half of our order was mis@@ sing .
never got an ex@@ plan@@ ation as to what was going on .
the manag@@ er was ru@@ de and hand@@ led the situation extremely po@@ or@@ ly .
" when we thre@@ aten@@ ed to leave , we were offer@@ ed a me@@ ager dis@@ coun@@ t even though half the order was mis@@ sing . "
" on the way out , we heard of other gu@@ est@@ s compla@@ ining about similar issues . "
can 't believe how an expen@@ sive ny@@ c restau@@ rant can be so dis@@ respect@@ ful to its cli@@ ents .
what a ha@@ ss@@ le !
" the food is very good , but not out@@ standing . "
" there is no way it justifi@@ es the accol@@ ades it recei@@ ves , the attitude of the staff or the wait for a table . "
" on our last visit , they ski@@ pped over our name on the list , leav@@ ing us waiting an extra hour for a table . "
" mist@@ akes happen , but they are usu@@ ally ac@@ compan@@ i@@ ed by an apo@@ lo@@ gy , perhaps even a gla@@ ss of w@@ ine ... but not the grun@@ t that we received from the al di la staff . "
expen@@ sive
" the bre@@ ad was st@@ ale , the sala@@ d was over@@ pri@@ ced and emp@@ ty . "
" the pa@@ sta was well co@@ o@@ ked , didn 't have enough sau@@ ce though or fla@@ vor . "
so ru@@ de ! ! !
i was one of the people that went for this hor@@ ri@@ ble experience .
the ho@@ st@@ ess was ru@@ de and i got a distin@@ ct fe@@ eling that they did not want to serve us .
the only thing that my friend left out is that when we sat down at the bar the bar@@ ten@@ der dis@@ appe@@ ared .
i asked for a menu and the same wa@@ it@@ re@@ ss looked at my like i was insan@@ e .
" i was sho@@ cked that my friends wanted to stay after the wa@@ it@@ re@@ ss said , " " can i help you " " and " " how many are in your party . " " "
the three of us standing in front of her should have been an indi@@ cation of how many of us there were .
we didn 't look like the other patr@@ ons in there so unfortunately i think that may have been part of the problem .
sh@@ ame on this place for the hor@@ ri@@ ble ru@@ de staff and non-@@ exist@@ ent cu@@ stom@@ er service .
bad staff
i gener@@ ally like this place .
the food is good .
the de@@ sign of the space is good .
but the service is hor@@ rid !
" i was there for br@@ un@@ ch recently , and we were tag te@@ am@@ ed by a wa@@ it@@ re@@ ss and a wa@@ iter . "
the wa@@ iter deli@@ ver@@ ed our food while hol@@ ding what appe@@ ared to be a pla@@ stic bag of gar@@ ba@@ ge in one hand .
" i can 't believe that it was , but please put the bag down before deli@@ ver@@ ing food ! "
" the wa@@ it@@ re@@ ss came to check in on us every few minutes , and be@@ gan to clear the plat@@ es while half of us were still e@@ ating ( a big pet pe@@ eve of mine that happen@@ s almost every@@ where , so i try to ign@@ ore it ) . "
" i couldn 't ign@@ ore the fact that she reach over the pl@@ ate of one of my friends , who was in mid b@@ ite , to clear the table . "
" she then put the check down without asking if we were done , and came to check on the bill every two minutes , even though we were one of three occu@@ pied ta@@ bles . "
" i wish i could like this place more , and i wish someone would re@@ train the staff . "
