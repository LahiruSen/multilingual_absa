"The food was very good, a great deal, and the place its self was great."
Terrible would be a compliment!
The place is a lot of fun.
"However, I think Jeckll and Hydes t is one of those places that is fun to do once."
The service was friendly and the atmosphere was casual.
please don't fool us.
not sure why this restaurant would be rated that highly.
"Love the scene first off- the place has a character and nice light to it..very fortunate, location wise."
This place has great indian chinese food.
"The Four Seasons has history and it is a sort of landmark of New York City restaurants, but trust me, they will charge you through the nose just so that you can say ""I've been to the four seasons restaurant""."
Pizza was a little soggy.
Can't wait to go back.
I will go back to Suan soon!
The wine list is also really nice.
Great bagels made the old-fashioned way.
This place...god where do i begin.
Quick and friendly service.
"My father had the flank steak which was very good, and my mother had the swordfish."
"Bagels are ok, but be sure not to make any special requests!"
The sake’s complimented the courses very well and is successfully easing me into the sake world.
"Food is usually very good, though ocasionally I wondered about freshmess of raw vegatables in side orders."
It's simply the best meal in NYC.
The waiter delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand.
"However, our $14 drinks were were horrible!"
"Both times I was extremely dissappointed by the service, which was boarderline rude."
it's delicious!
"Going to Bark is always worth the train ride, and will make your tongue and belly very happy!"
Great Atmosphere
The service was the only thing good about this restaurant.
First went here to enjoy their garden terrace.
I almost hesititate to write a review because the atmosphere was so great and I would hate for it too become to crowded.
The only thing more wonderful than the food (which is exceptional) is the service.
The veal was incredible last night.
I would highly recommend this place!
"For a restaurant with such a good reputation and that is usually so packed, there was no reason for such a lack of intelligent customer service."
"The staff was accomodating, the food was absolutely delicious and the place is lovely."
"Inside is a little cramped, but to be expected."
"A gentleman, maybe the manager, came to our table, and without so much as a smile or greeting asked for our order."
We all felt it was worth it.
I have never been so disgusted by both food an service.
"I am not a vegetarian but, almost all the dishes were great."
"La Rosa waltzes in, and I think they are doing it the best."
The design of the space is good.
"The vibe is very relaxed and cozy, service was great and the food was excellent!"
The decor is very simple but comfortable.
"The large selection of bruschettas, paninis, tramezzinis keep the palate from stagnating."
The farro salad and the mashed yukon potatoes were also extremely tasty.
We had a very nice time.
They wouldnt even let me finish my glass of wine before offering another.
It's to die for!
Try the lobster teriyaki and the rose special roll.
I absolutely Loved this place.
Although we were looking for regular lettuce and some walnuts the salads we got were great.
and yes Dal Bukhara is so dam good and so are all the kababs.
We were ushered to the bar to wait momentarily and upon arrival were so excited.
I also recommend the rice dishes or the different varieties of congee (rice porridge).
"For instance, plates were just dumped on the table, I was handed the wine list upside down, etc.... "
We were then shooed inside.
"I also ordered the Change Mojito, which was out of this world."
"The space kind of feels like an Alice in Wonderland setting, without it trying to be that."
Pizza here is consistently good.
I book a gorgeous white organza tent which included a four course prix fix menu which we enjoyed a lot.
Always great service!
Very pleased
"I must say I am surprised by the bad reviews of the restaurant earlier in the year, though."
Service is not what you are coming here for...
I really loved the different and inovated touch that's the cheff gives to the food.
Consistently good Japanese Tapas.
"In the summer months, the back garden area is really nice."
It just wasn't Thai.
"In about 12 minutes, the thing is gone."
The main entree was also very good.
The appetizers are also delicious!
But the best pork souvlaki I ever had is the main thing.
Delivery is fast too.
It's somewhere you can eat and be happy.
Just go to Yamato and order the Red Dragon Roll.
"We did tip, I guess the model/waitress just wanted more and complained to the manager."
Ravioli was good...but I have to say that I found everything a bit overpriced.
Super YUMMY Pizza!
"Sometimes tables don't understand his sense of humor but it's refreshing to have a server who has personality, professionalism, and respects the privacy of your dinner."
"the salads are delicious, both refreshing and very spicy."
Some Pineapple covered in a glaze of some kind and some pear tart thing Not impressive at all.
"This place has totally weird decor, stairs going up with mirrored walls - I am surprised how no one yet broke their head or fall off the stairs - mirrored walls make you dizzy and delusional..."
"The tables are crammed way too close, the menu is typical of any Italian restaurant, and the wine list is simply overpriced."
"The restaurant has a Family feel, not least with regard to the portions which are enormous; the veal alone could have single-handedly solved third world famine."
I would highly recommend it.
"It is set far from the small street it's on, and there is no traffic noise."
Everything on the menu is great. 
"I'm a friendly person, so I wouldn't mind had she not been so nasty and gotten so personal. "
Good for dates or with friends.
my favorite place lol
We've tried before but it always packed and doesn't take reservations.
"The chicken pot pie is excpetiona, the cheeseburger huge and delictable, and the service professional wan warm."
"The portion sizes here are huge, and the sushi is good."
"Food took some time to prepare, all worth waiting for."
I thanked my friend who recommended me this restaurant and will certainly recommend it to others.
Quite simply it's like stepping out of Manhattan and into a haven of tranquility.
Fantastic!
"Inexpensive, unassuming, great time!"
Don't be fooled by crowds of people.
"The pastas are incredible, the risottos (particularly the sepia) are fantastic and the braised rabbit is amazing."
The hostess was very pleasant.
"To be completely fair, the only redeeming factor was the food, which was above average, but couldn't make up for all the other deficiencies of Teodora."
Patroon features a nice cigar bar and has great staff.
Check this place out!
Went there with my wife and we had to wait for a table even though you could see there many that were empty with not reservation sigh on them.
So what you really end up paying for is the restaurant not the food.
Too bad I had paid an extra $2 for the stone bowl.
"Maybe it was the great company (I had friends visiting from Philly – yes, it was not a date this time) or the super reasonable price point, but I just can’t say enough good things about this brasserie."
wont come back again for sure!
"Rather than preparing vegetarian dish, the chef presented me with a plate of steamed vegetables (minus sauce, seasoning, or any form or aesthetic presentation)."
I ordered the vitello alla marsala and I was pretty impressed.
"I have reservations about the all you can eat deal, however -- the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than $18 by just going off the menu."
"From the spectacular caviar to the hospitable waitstaff, I felt like royalty and enjoyed every second of it."
Not what I would expect for the price and prestige of this location.
For each course we waited over 1/2 hour to 45 minutes and were never offered a drink.
But the pizza is way to expensive.
"As BFC doesn't take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar - and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated, which can be over an hour later!"
The service was excellent and the food was delicious.
"If we were to move from the upper east side, we would genuinely miss this restaurant."
"Overall the food quality was pretty good, though I hear the salmon is much better when it hasn't sat cooling in front of the guest."
"The DJ is awesome, I have been there for my birthday and a bunch of other times with friends and I keep going back."
Prices are in line.
I think the pizza is so overrated and was under cooked.
Well...they can run but they can't hide.
"Not much of a selection of bottled beer either, we went with Brahma. "
This has got to be one of the most overrated restaurants in Brooklyn.
How is this palce still open?
I CAN EAT HERE EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK REALLY LOL LOVE THIS PLACE ...)
"peppers, onions, relish, chilli, cheeses, you NAME it."
"It was the first place we ate on our first trip to New York, and it will be the last place we stop as we head out of town on our next trip to New York."
The dining room is quietly elegant with no music to shout over -- how refreshing!
"We were worried we would have trouble getting in, but somehow managed to have a short wait."
I am actually offended to have spent so much money on such a bad experience.
This is the perfect date spot for Williamsburg couples.
For starters they delivered us someone else's order.
"All the various Greek and Cypriot dishes are excellent, but the gyro is the reason to come--if you don't eat one your trip was wasted."
Just not good at all.
The manager was rude and handled the situation extremely poorly.
"If you're into being lost when you're just five feet from your table then hey, that's a good thing."
"also it's great to have dinner in a very romantic and confortable place, the service it's just perfect...they're so frendly that we never want to live the place!"
The rolls are creative and I have yet to find another sushi place that serves up more inventive yet delicious japanese food.
sometimes i get good food and ok service.
"It is nearly impossible to get a table, so if you ever have the chance to go here for dinner, DO NOT pass it up."
"I can't believe that it was, but please put the bag down before delivering food!"
Food is excellent.
"Best Indian Chinese in the city, by far!"
The lunch buffet is expensive but is deff worth it.
"The ambience was nice, but service wasn't so great."
Not a very fancy place but very good Chinese style Indian food.
Who has room for Cheesesticks with the best pizza in NYC!
"When asked about how a certain dish was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants, he replied this is not Mcdonald's, every place makes things differently "
"It's just average, just shredded, no seasoning on it."
Ingredients are organic which is a real plus for me.
Definitely a great spot for a nice occasion or date.
We didn't look like the other patrons in there so unfortunately I think that may have been part of the problem.
not only is the food
What more could you want?
"When my dessert came, there was a candle in it - not because anyone asked for one - but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift, and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort."
the waitstaffs are nice though.
I go twice a month!
"It's a little out of our price range for dining there except on special occasions, but we've eaten there 6 times in the last 2 years. "
"I wanted to go there to see if it was worth it and sadly, curiousity got the best of me and I paid dearly for it."
Best Indian Restaurant in the City
The food was exceptional.
Everyone must come here at least once.
This place would be so much better served by being run by a group that actually understands customer service.
Big Wong is a great place to eat and fill your stomach.
"At first glance this place seems a bit pricey for a hot dog joint, but at Bark you don't just get your average hot dog."
I can't wait to go back.
I've been many time and have never been disappointed.
"Fabulous decor - makes you feel like you're in a trendy Manhattan restaurant, very very good food, cheaply-priced, generally friendly staff, and if you're a Manhattanite, or spend most of your time in Manhattan, Rice Avenue will make you feel at home.....very Soho/Village/Upper West Side minus the expensive prices and pretentious clientele.....all on Roosevelt Avenue!"
"We thought the dessert would be better, Wrong!"
Best In ALL of NYC
"The last two times I ordered from here my food was soo spicy that  I could barely eat it, and the spice took away from the flavor of the dish."
The bar is very well stocked with interesting beers and well priced wines.
It's a rather cramped and busy restaurant and it closes early.
and you can't beat the prices.
"The seafood is amazing, there's a good wine list, and the ever-changing menu always offers some great surprises."
I'll be back for sure.
I HAVE NEVER EVER HAD SUCH AN UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE.
Best drumsticks over rice and sour spicy soup in town!
Surprisingly nothing could be further from the truth.
Less than three minutes passed before I found myself doubled over the toilet.
Wine list selection is good and wine-by-the-glass was generously filled to the top.
"When we sat, we got great and fast service."
"Creative, consistent, fresh."
"Try the congee and the donut like deep fried dough they call Ow Ley Soh, a delicious and sweet tasting bread."
"Their calzones are horrific, bad, vomit-inducing, YUCK."
The exotic food is beautifully presented and is a delight in delicious combinations.
Wine list is extensive without being over-priced.
The have a great cocktail with Citrus Vodka and lemon and lime juice and mint leaves that is to die for!
"Service was devine, oysters where a sensual as they come, and the price can't be beat!!!"
"The food however, is what one might expect."
Great Indian food
Salads were fantastic.
The nakgi-bokum was horrible.
Service was slow had to wait to order and get food although not crowded.
everyone was cheerfully cooperative and helpful.
Love YUKA.
We went around 9:30 on a Friday and it had died down a bit by then so the service was great!
"The manager finally said he would comp the two glasses of wine (which cost less than the food), and made it seem like a big concession."
"This is the MOST wonderful restaurant in all of New York City, not just Brooklyn..."
Worth visiting the 1st Ave spot because it is the original store.
Try sushimi cucumber roll.
It's a nice place to relax and have conversation.
"Still, any quibbles about the bill were off-set by the pour-your-own measures of liquers which were courtesey of the house..."
Only complaint is the pricing--I believe it would be more reasonable to pay a dollar less on each item listed on the menu.
Excellent food for great prices
"I like the ambience, it's very dark and original."
I have been going there since it opened and I can't get enough.
Service is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category.
"Yes, they use fancy ingredients, but even fancy ingredients don't make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right."
I have been going back again and again.
"The service is ok, some of the people didn't get what they asked for."
"Pizza - the only pizza in NYC that should not have additional toppings - the crust tastes like the best, freshly baked bread!"
"The place has a nice fit-out, some attractive furnishings and, from what I could tell, a reasonable wine list (I was given the food menu when I asked for the carte des vins)"
Try it!
Indoor was very cozy and cute.
great hot dogs..
"This place is pricey, and yes, the food is worth it; but the service makes you feel like you should be paying a quater of the price."
Your friends will thank you for introducing them to this gem!
Always busy but fast moving.
I loved this place!!
"Thalia is a beautiful restaurant with beautiful people serving you, but the food doesn't quite match up."
I have been to Roth's twice and both times were very disappointing.
We ordered some beef and noodle soup dishes from the Thai section of the menu but nothing we got was Thai.
i love their chicken pasta cant remember the name but is sooo good
Poor service and management
the crust was imazingly cooked well and pizza was fully loaded:):):)
"During the course of the past 3 months, the chef and staff changed and it was not for the better."
Excellent spot for holiday get togethers with co-workers or friends that you haven't seen in a while.
The food is reliable and the price is moderate.
"If you are the type of person who likes being scared and entertained, this is a great place to go and eat."
Even my Indian friend couldn't believe how good and tasty everything was.
The omlette for brunch is great...
it is not consistent.
Have the iced tea.
"The manager came to the table and said we can do what we want, so we paid for what we did enjoy, the drinks and appetizers, and walked out."
"Guacamole+shrimp appetizer was really great, we both had the filet, very good, didn't much like the frites that came with, but the filet was so good, neither of us cared."
"Yes, the prices are high, but I felt it was worth it."
Food was good not great not worth the wait or another visit
Myagi is one of my favorite restaurants in the City; the place the negative reviews describe sound like they were somewhere else.
"Even though its good seafood, the prices are too high."
Had no flavor and the staff is rude and not attentive.
"The waitress moved our table practically into the bathroom and when we asked to cancel our dinner orders because we did not want to eat sitting on the toilet, we were told no..."
"Kind, attentive wait staff."
"While it is understandable that every place is indeed different, there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude."
Helpful service and average price per dish $10.
The food tasted very good.
The atmosphere is noisy and the waiters are literally walking around doing things as fast as they can.
This is one of the best comfort food places in the city.
"This restaurant was recommended by a local...as a matter of fact, he made the reservation for us and said we would not be disappointed!"
Definately check it out!!!
"I picked the Grilled Black Cod as my entree, which I absolutely devoured while someone commented that the Grilled Salmon dish was better."
You will find yourself returning quite often.
A real dissapointment.
"Service was prompt, friendly and great."
You can do it here.
Maggot in the food!
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!
None was made so i hung up.
"With so many poor experiences to be had in the theater district, is truly an excellent find!"
first it took us a long time to find the place.
SO GOOD
"I showed it to the manager, and he smilingly apologized and brought us two free desserts (but did not ask us what we wanted and so brought the last two desserts we would have asked for)."
You can't go wrong with this place.
Unhygienic
food was luke warm.
Food was OK.
It is quite a spectacular scene i'll give them that.
Great Shabu Shabu
"Overall, excellent restaurant!"
"For the price, you cannot eat this well in Manhattan."
The shrimp scampi was excellent and the antipasti were plentiful.
"I didn't complain, I liked the atmosphere so much."
The Yellowtail was particularly good as well.
I am reluctant to write because I would not want my jem of a pizza place to become overcrowded.
"for 7 years they have put out the most tasty, most delicious food and kept it that way..."
"There was a small wait, but shorter than I expected."
I started out with a Bombay beer which was big enough for two.
"Nobody at this restaurant will give firm answers about anything and in the end, not one person takes responsibility for anything."
Over all it was a very nice romantic place .
"For the people who want great food plus great service, Roxy is a place to AVOID!"
Service was also very good.
It’s just you and your date and an occasional cute ‘excuse me’ before the waiter opens the little curtain to your booth!
"While finishing our meals which included a high-end bottle of wine, our son's fiance joined us for a glass of wine and dessert."
I would highly recommend.
I've been there three times and have always had wonderful experiences.
"A word to the wise: you can't dine here and disturb the maitre-D's sense of "" table turnover"", as whacked as it is, or else."
10
you should travel from the Bronx to try it...
"The whole set up is truly unprofessional and I wish Cafe Noir would get some good staff, because despite the current one this is a great place."
"Great service, great food."
"Also, they do not take credit card so come with cash!"
Lexicographers take note: a new and fascinating definition of rudeness is alive and flourishing right here in Brooklyn.
This place is so much fun.
"Leon is an East Village gem: casual but hip, with well prepared basic French bistro fare, good specials, a warm and lively atmosphere."
They smell like they stuff them with old canned vegetables like the spinach mushroom calzone.
"The crust is thin, the ingredients are fresh and the staff is friendly."
I take all my NYC guests to VT's.
I highly recommend it.
"This is one of my favorite spot, very relaxing the food is great all the times , celebrated my engagement and my wedding here , it was very well organized ."
"Although the tables may be closely situated, the candle-light, food-quality and service overcompensate."
I will be out with friends and all of a sudden I am hungry and I only crave one thing... their Pizza.
Rao's has the best service and atmosphere in NYC.
Can't wait to go back.
I recieved prompt service with a smile.
Prices too high for this cramped and unappealing resturant.
I highly recommend this beautiful place.
This is one of my favorite restaurants and it is not to be missed.
We didn't want a bottle of bubbly on a weekday so we each got little bottles of Korbett it was just enough. 
The food is so cheap and the waiters are nice.
"They are extremely rude, not even apologizing for the horrible service we got and handing us a bill well over $500 for some drinks adn their pita bread!"
We asked for sides which the waiter than admitted that he forgot to put in that part of our order.
The flavors robust and subtle.
"Even though the place is not beautiful, the food speaks for itself."
highly recommended.
My quesadilla tasted like it had been made by a three-year old with no sense of proportion or flavor.
"Calling the place Hampton Chutney Co. does warn you that these folks offer more style than substance, but in this unattractive room with unhelpful clerks there was a dearth of the former too."
Winnie and her staff are the best crew you can find serving you.
"those rolls were big, but not good and sashimi wasn't fresh."
"The bar drinks were Eh, ok to say the least."
Raymond the bartender rocks!
Noodle pudding is exactly the type of service and food I enjoy.
"We ate out in the back patio, which is worth it as it's cool and the music is hear well there."
I cannot imagine a friendlier staff working in a restaurant.
this is can became on e of the NY Italian Food fare institutions.
Big Wong gets big Ups for a fine establishment.
The potato balls were not dry at all... in fact it was buttery.
it was really good pizza.
Worth the trip from Manhattan.
"i know, you were too busy showing off your vintage tee shirt and looking bored, but my agenda is i'm here to eat and enjoy the company of friends, seeking a pleasant experience."
"Considering you will spend at least $60 a head, I expect better service. "
Very cozy and warm inside.....
The counter service is bad.
"We had half/half pizza, mine was eggplant and my friend had the buffalo and it was sooo huge for a small size pizza!"
The food now is inconsistent.
Loved it
"Their bagels are fine, but they are a little overcooked, and not really a 'special' bagel experience."
"Moules were excellent, lobster ravioli was VERY salty!"
The spicy Tuna roll is huge and probably the best that I've had at this price range.
"Again, no apology, no is there anything else I can get you, no can I get you a drink to make up for it, nothing!!!!"
Yakitori (bbq meats) is tasty too.
We won't go to this place again for a good meal.
Truly the mark of an attentive waiter.
I recommend this place to everyone.
"So, I switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe I could stomach the meat and spinach again, but the spinach was so undercooked that I just could not bite through it."
"Just straight up cheap, good food."
"They have great rolls, the triple color and norwegetan rolls, are awesome and filling."
I have to say I have never had a disapointing meal here.
This place survives on reputation alone.
"Despite a slightly limited menu, everything prepared is done to perfection, ultra fresh and a work of food art."
The place is so cool and the service is prompt and curtious.
Service was also horrible and the ambience is not that great.
"service is friendly, and never had a problem walking in and getting a table."
Wretched and retching
Sushi experience was unbelievable with my fiance.
Go there to relax and feel like your somewhere else.
Chicken teriyaki had tomato or pimentos on top??
The atmosphere was great.
"Not only is the cuisine the best around, the service has always been attentive and charming."
The food is authentic Italian - delicious!
I asked for an open faced cheese sandwich and the manager basically told me to take my business elsewhere!
Mine was a little burnt but still delicious with goat cheese and panchetta (raddichio was kind of bitter though).
When we inquired about ports - the waitress listed off several but did not know taste variations or cost.
Best. Sushi. Ever.
The food arrived in about 15 minutes. 
Stepped on my foot on the SECOND time he reached over me to adjust lighting.
Ive asked a cart attendant for a lotus leaf wrapped rice and she replied back rice and just walked away.
"Service is not exactly five star, but thats not really a big deal."
"Consequently, their burgers fell apart in their hands and made such a mess that they did'nt feel like finishing them."
"(that is A MUST, but not every restaurant can do...) "
"There was no tap beer that evening, which was a disappointment. "
WORST PLACE ON SMITH STREET IN BROOKLYN
"Great food, good size menu, great service and an unpretensious setting."
All the staff is absolutely professional!! 
Best Taiwanese food in NY!
"The atmosphere isn't the greatest , but I suppose that's how they keep the prices down ."
This restaurant is VEGETARIAN; there are NO MEAT dishes whatsoever.
Save your money and your time and go somewhere else.
"However, our main course was wonderful."
It was totally overpriced- fish and chips was about $15.... 
I'm not picky - but it was actually gross.
Fish is so very fresh.
It's all about the food !!
"Everyone seemed generally happy with their food, except my brother who had the grilled Mahi Mahi, seemingly drenched in Grapfruit Juice! "
Much of the time it seems like they do not care about you.
"To sum it up: Service varies from good to mediorce, depending on which waiter you get; generally it is just average Ok. "
Warning: You may find it difficult to dine at other Japanese restaurants after a visit to Mizu!
"Love this place, every time we are in the city this is one of the places we always go."
No plans to return anytime soon.
"Service was slow, but the people were friendly."
"But after last night, Spice Grill is the only place I'm eating indian cuisine."
The takeout is great too since they give high quality tupperware as well.
"Cool atmosphere, the fire place in the back really ads to it but needs a bit more heat throughout on a cold night."
LOVE the atmosphere - felt like I was in Paris.
Had an awful experience at Casa la Femme on a Saturday dinner.
"The food we ordered was excellent, although I wouldn't say the margaritas were anything to write home about."
So rushing us out was absolutely unnecessary!
Service was prompt and courteous.
A little overpriced but worth it once you take a bite.
We ate at this Thai place following the reviews but very unhappy with the foods.
I ate here a week ago and found most dishes average at best and too expensive.
"The ambience was so fun, and the prices were great, on top of the fact that the food was really tasty."
"She then put the check down without asking if we were done, and came to check on the bill every two minutes, even though we were one of three occupied tables."
The real problem I had with this place was the complete lack of service.
The food was lousy - too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny.
Mazing interior.
The sauce tasted more like Chinese fast food than decent Korean.
"The quantity is also very good, you will come out satisfied."
Kind of a small place but I guess if they are not too busy might be able to fit a group or kids.
Avoid this place!
Traditional French decour was pleasant though the hall was rather noisy - the restaurant was full and we had to raise our voices to be able to maintain a conversation.
Chennai Garden is my favorite Indian restaurant in the city.
I thought I had died and gone to heaven.
"however, it's the service that leaves a bad taste in my mouth."
"Just because it's cheap does NOT mean the portions are small or the food is nasty, IT IS GREAT!"
I highly recommend visiting this restaurant and having dinner and drinks!
But that wasn't the icing on the cake: a tiramisu that resembled nothing I have ever had.
"Planet Thailand has always been a hit with me , I go there usually for the sushi, which is great , the thai food is excellent too ."
"Bukhara Grill, the tagline says it all.. ""INDIAN SPICE RAVE"""
"I have worked in restaurants and cook a lot, and there is no way a maggot should be able to get into well prepared food."
We were offered water for the table but were not told the Voss bottles of water were $8 a piece.
The level of rudeness was preposterous.
Good Food
The waitress was not attentive at all.
We were less than impressed.
We never ate because by close to 2 in the monring we were not served and were too upset ad tired to start eating.
Have frequented 'ino for several years and the food remains excellent.
"My main concern was the sanity of the food that was being sent out to myself and others, but I would be lying is I said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen I was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation."
Can’t believe how an expensive NYC restaurant can be so disrespectful to its clients.
I will definetly be going back.
This is an amazing place to try some roti rolls.
THIS STAFF SHOULD BE FIRED.
I highly recommend to anyone to give this place a try.
"the spinach is fresh, definately not frozen..."
And where does Patis go wrong; no where. 
"The bagels always warm, soft on the inside, crispy on the outside and enormous in size."
"I've also been amazed at all the new additions in the past few years: A new Jazz Bar, the most fantastic Dining Garden, the Best Thin Crust Pizzas, and now a Lasagna Menu which is to die for (these are not your average lasagnas)!"
My friend got the mushroom pizza which tasted better.
"My husbands was perfect, my was well done and dry."
"I LOOOVE their eggplant pizza, as well as their pastas!"
"Wish NY had more of these kind of places: intimate, superb food, homey, top notch all the way around, certainly worth the wait."
Once you try it for a special occasion beware.. you can't stop!
It is very overpriced and not very tasty.
The food is tasty and portion sizes are appropriate.
"The waitress, seems to be more concerned of looking good than actually waitressing."
Appetizers took nearly an hour.
One of us actually liked the expresso - that's it.
great toppings definitely a place you need to check out for late night munchies or a mid day boost!
Mussles and calamari were superb Saturday evening.
Authentic Pakistani food.
"I was so stunned, and I left the dinner hungry and majorly disappointing."
"Fresh, mind blowing flavors."
"As many other reviewers noticed, your order is often slow to arrive - this is particularly true in the evening but is not a problem during lunch time."
"Be prepared to wait, because the place is pretty tiny."
Good creative rolls!
The food here was mediocre at best. 
Polite acknowledgement is out;
"I like the somosas, chai, and the chole, but the dhosas and dhal were kinda dissapointing."
My wife and I ate here earlier this week and have not stopped ranting and raving about the food.
"Of course, it is crowded but who cares."
And I hate to say this but I doubt I'll ever go back. 
The staff is no nonsense.
The food was ok and fair nothing to go crazy.
The jukebox plays everything from Italian Opera to The Strokes.
The service was attentive.
Go there once and oh yes...you will go back...you will...
The setting is casual and romantic.
I think I've had some the best meals of my life at minnow.
A quintessential slice of NYC pizza.
"great for a romantic evening, or a fun evening with friends..."
The price very reasonable.
Good Experience
This is the kind of place you'd like to take all your friends to and still keep a secret.
"Personally I like the margherita pizza better, but they are all good."
Fresh ingredients and everything is made to order.
Great place to relax and enjoy your dinner
"A different server enhanced the fun, dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer (which was delicious)."
I'd definitely go back again.
"The food is wonderful, tasty and filling, and the service is professional and friendly."
"Don't dine at Tamarind for the vegetarian dishes, they are simply not up to par with the non-veg selections."
I will be going back very soon.
"If you venture off the island of Manhattan and can't seem to find a great Italian restaurant, drive to Corona."
We could have made a meal of the yummy dumplings from the dumpling menu.
Somehow working the italian charm with constant mille grazie does not constitute proper service.
"I attended a holiday dinner at the restaurant, and the food was majorly disappointing."
"I have tried to make reservations, but both times, the hostess didn't have my name."
"They never brought us complimentary noodles, ignored repeated requests for sugar, and threw our dishes on the table."
"I have eaten at Saul, many times, the food is always consistently, outrageously good."
"sometimes i get bad food and bad service, sometimes i get good good and bad service."
If I could give 0 stars I would do so for this place.
Prices are very good.
We waited at the bar and had martinis that were just right.
Not one of our meals was edible - bland and/or made with weird rosemary or orange flavoring.
"There is no way it justifies the accolades it receives, the attitude of the staff or the wait for a table."
"He served me an Uni Hand roll, which I never had before, and let me tell you...IT WAS HEAVEN!"
"Only drawback - they won't toast your bagel, and they don't make eggs for the bagel."
I had never had Edamame pureed before but I thought it was innovative and tasty (could've used a bit more salt).
Our experience did not ever get any better.
"the only things u could really taste are the very salty soy sauce (even its low sodium), the vinegar-soaked rice, and the scallion on top of the fish. "
"The meat is fresh, the sauces are great, you get kimchi and a salad free with your meal and service is good too."
Dessert is a joke...dont bother
The food was good.
The food is great and they have a good selecion of wines at reasonable prices.
"The blond wood decor is very soothing, the premium sake is excellent and the service is great."
We ended our great experience by having Gulab Jamun (dessert) recommended by the waiter.
"The menu looked great, and the waiter was very nice, but when the food came, it was average."
"The staff has been nice, but they seemed really stressed and the unisex bathroom needs to be cleaned more often."
Saul is the best restaurant on Smith Street and in Brooklyn.
"Other guests enjoyed pizza, santa fe chopped salad and fish and chips."
If you like your music blasted and the system isnt that great and if you want to pay at least 100 dollar bottle minimun then you'll love it here.
"The food is very average...the Thai fusion stuff is a bit too sweet, every thing they serve is too sweet here."
This is my first time writing a review for a restaurant because the food and service was excellent.
I highly recommend the restaurant based on our experience last night.
Service is top notch.
A weakness is the chicken in the salads.
They refuse to seat parties of 3 or more on weekends.
"However, I think this place is a good hang out spot."
"In the evening, this place attracted a well dressed, with it, NY crowd."
We had a great time at the Jekyll and hyde Pub last night.
When I lived upstate for a while I would buy freeze the bagels and they would still be better than any else.
I went there for lunch and it was not as good as I expected from the reviews I read.
Most of the booths allow you to sit next to eachother without looking like 'that' couple.
It was pretty inexpensive too.
The rice was poor quality and was cooked so badly it was hard.
Add to that great service and great food at a reasonable price and you have yourself the beginning of a great evening.
"For authentic Thai food, look no further than Toons."
"At first we were a little taken aback, as this seemed to present a problem, although the restaurant looked fairly empty, but they hastily put the table together for us."
"Its dark, and cozy.. there is always jazz music playing when we go."
Loved it!
I had a great experience.
"The crust has a great bite and a good chew, the sauce is light with a nice acidity to it, the salt from the cheese is great, really heightens the flavor of all the other components."
the all-u-can-eat sushi is definitely in very poor quality.
You cannot go wrong at the Red Eye Grill.
Surprised that a place of this caliber would advertise it as Kobe.
A beautifully designed dreamy Egyptian restaurant that gets sceney at night.
Everyone raved about the atmosphere (elegant rooms and absolutely incomparable views) and the fabulous food!
I would highly recommand requesting a table by the window.
"I had their eggs benedict for brunch, which were the worst in my entire life, I tried removing the hollondaise sauce completely that was how failed it was."
The food is great.
Service was wonderful;
Service is average.
There is a lot of variety even for people who eat vegetarian like me.
We were drawn into the belly dancing show that captivated the crowd.
Be sure not to get anything other than bagels!..
"Our visit their to say the least, was an unpleasant and costly experience!"
The food was actually aweful.
"The floor was wet, the trash can filled with hand towels n all over the floor, no soap, and no hand towels left."
I will be going back and heartily recommend it!
He offers subpar service and has no personality.
This place is the most Japanese it can ever get.
We will be back.
The boths are not as small as some of the reviews make them out to look they're perfect for 2 people.
Terrible Waste of money.. scammers
This was a repeat visit and we'll definitely be back again.
"Great vibe, lots of people."
Will absolutely visit again.
Fantastic place.
Slightly above average wines start at $70+ with only one selection listed at $30+.
"Food was very good, but not what I would consider out of this world."
"Quite frankly, this is some of the worst sushi I have ever tried."
"Excellent dumplings served amid clean, chic decor."
"Food was just average...if they lowered the prices just a bit, it would be a bigger draw."
"Do not get the Go Go Hamburgers, no matter what the reviews say."
"Then, to top things off, she dropped used silverware on my boyfriend's jacket and did not stop to apologize or clean the mess that was left on clothes. "
"The place is a bit hidden away, but once you get there, it's all worth it."
Highly recommended!
"We have been to this place many times, and always have great food, wine, and service."
I loved it and would go again.
Everyone was more then happy with his choices.
"well, i didn't find it there, and trust, i have told everyone i can think of about my experience. "
They charge different prices all the time.
The waitress was very patient with us and the food is phenomenal!
Over 100 different choices to create your own.
The portions are small but being that the food was so good makes up for that.
The rice to fish ration was also good--they didn't try to overpack the rice.
"Delicious, creative and fun."
"Overall, not worth the money."
"The kitchen however, is almost always slow."
"Very immature bartender, didnt know how to make specific drinks, service was so slowwwww, the food was not fresh or warm, waitresses were busy flirting with men at the bar and werent very attentive to all the customers."
This place is always packed.
This is the first place I've been that a runner remembers my order... hope he likes his job because I have half a mind to steal him for my restaurant.
"Pizza is terrific, as is homemade pasta."
I never write on these sites but this restaurant is def worth commending!
Such a disappointment...
"With the great variety on the menu , I eat here often and never get bored ."
"Volare virgins or weekly regulars, everyone gets treated the same and you can't ask for more than that when the service is this friendly."
It is obvious that no one in the restaurant has any idea about or experience with Japanese cuisine.
I will be back!
It looked like shredded cheese partly done - still in strips.
"My mom originally introduced me to this place, but even she (being Indian) feels the food can be somewhat over the top spicy and far too oily."
This place is incredibly tiny.
Impressed...
"Try the Pad Thai, it's fabulous and their prices are so cheap!"
One of the best hot dogs I have ever eaten.
"If you go, try the marinara/arrabiatta sauce, the mozzarella en Carozza is mmmmmmmm..... everything is just delicious."
"Took my mom for Mother's Day, and the maitre d' was pretty rude."
You will not be disapointed at all.
We even had a visit from the Manager who wanted to make sure we were enjoying ourselves.
Not impressed with the food.
This dish is my favorite and I always get it when I go there and never get tired of it.
The restaurant is a bit noisy but that is something that can be overlooked once you sit down and enjoy a great meal
DO not try unless you're just going there to hang out like the rest of the hipsters who apparently have no sense of taste.
I won't go back unless someone else is footing the bill.
"The rest of the dim sum, though pricey by Chinatown standards, is worth it."
"My wife and I always enjoy the young, not always well trained but nevertheless friendly, staff, all of whom have a story."
Don't miss Bloom's on your next trip to Manhatten.
"On our last visit, they skipped over our name on the list, leaving us waiting an extra hour for a table."
I really like both the scallops and the mahi mahi (on saffron risotto-yum!).
My daughter's wedding reception at Water's Edge received the highest compliments from our guests.
They honored reservation on Sunday afternoon very well. 
My six year old loved it.
This is by far my favorite place in the neighborhood.
And it was quick which is very important.
"Once you step into Cosette, you're miraculously in a small, off-the-beaten path Parisian bistro."
We were charged full price.
"Great food, great decor, great service."
"If you don't like it, I don't know what to tell you."
"The decor is vibrant and eye-pleasing with several semi-private boths on the right side of the dining hall, which are great for a date."
"For desserts, we tried the frozen black sesame mousse (interesting but not extraordinary) and matcha (powdered green tea) and blueberry cheesecake, which was phenomenal."
What a great place!
We both opted for a pasta dish and they were served timely and fresh.
What we did do was waste 3 hours being trapped in a table waiting and waiting for food and drinks and hooka.. some of which we never received!
Vanison was good but not amazing.
"never swaying, never a bad meal, never bad service..."
"The wait staff is pleasant, fun, and for the most part gorgeous (in the wonderful aesthetic beautification way, not in that she's-way-cuter-than-me-that-b@#$* way)."
Great sushi experience.
(Besides that there should be more restaurants like it around the city).
It was divine melts in your mouth.
The food is a diamond in rough -- the food is delicious and homemade with the perfect balance of herbs and tomatoes.
Probably would not go back here.
"But for the Shabu Shabu, you won't find much better in NY."
"It's boring on the inside, and our sushi was pretty below average... the tuna was soggy and the other rolls had no flavor."
I recently went to this restaurant with some co-workers for lunch and had an amazing time.
"Service not the friendliest to our ""large party""! "
This establishment is the real deal. 
The pizza is yummy and I like the atmoshpere.
"The chicken lollipop is my favorite, most of the dishes (I have to agree with a previous reviewer) are quite oily and very spicy, espeically the Chilli Chicken."
"The dishes offered were unique, very tasty and fresh from the lamb sausages, sardines with biscuits, large whole shrimp to the amazing pistachio ice cream (the best and freshest I've ever had)."
We were not dissappointed in the least bit by this little gem.
I generally like this place.
"An unpretentious spot in Park Slope, the sushi is consistently good, the service is pleasant, effective and unassuming."
If you've ever been along the river in Weehawken you have an idea of the top of view the chart house has to offer.
This place is worth an one-hour drive.
Remind me of home.
THe perfect spot.
Food is great and inexpensive.
Nice view of river and NYC.
Which of course is not real Kobe but Wagyu beef.
Zero ambiance to boot.
Highly recommended to all!
"So close, but not good enough."
"The first time the sushi was outstanding, the second time it was a little bland."
"In fact, it appears he is going to go postal at any moment."
"Maitre-D-""Eat and get out"""
"Judging from previous posts this used to be a good place, but not any longer."
"For me dishes a little oily, but overall dining experience good."
"Place is open till late, no dress code."
"However, go for the ambience, and consider the food just a companion for a trip across the world!"
"A big disappointment, all around."
Hurley's is like Cheers where everyone knows your name and they are ACTUALLY glad you came.
The pizza is overpriced and soggy.
The owner and staff are all Japanese as well and that adds to the entire ambiance.
I love it.
Also very inexpensive.
The frizzy retro girl (with winged/ Dame Edna glasses) will yell at you if you try to order a drink. 
"The food was good, the place was clean and affordable."
Got a date? Go here!
It was wonderful.
But who says Murray's is anything about service.
Never fails to please.
I would go back.
The fried dumplings are GREAT!
"I was there for brunch recently, and we were tag teamed by a waitress and a waiter."
Best Reuben sandwich ever!
"The space is limited so be prepared to wait up to 45 minutes - 1 hour, but be richly rewarded when you savor the delicious indo-chinese food."
The atmosphere is relaxed and casual.
Best restaurant in Brooklyn
"Best of all is the warm vibe, the owner is super friendly and service is fast."
"With the exception of our lemon salad that had so much pepper on it that our eyes started watering, the food here was decent, not great."
The appetizers we ordered were served quickly - an order of fried oysters and clams were delicious but a tiny portion (maybe 3 of each). 
"I found it on a cold night, the perfect spot to warm up."
I'm partial to the Gnocchi.
We were greeted promptly by the waiter who was very nice and cordial.
The wine list is extensive and impressive.
"But the best part about LS is the late night atmosphere, delightfully free of the BTs."
"$6 and there is much tasty food, all of it fresh and continually refilled."
"A few tips: skip the turnip cake, roast pork buns and egg custards."
The servers at Flatbush Farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention.
"I've been to at Cafe Spice probably 5-8 times, it is probably still the best Indian restaurant around Union Square."
"Try the crunchy tuna, it is to die for."
"I come from a family of pizzeria owners, and I'm almost ashamed to say that the pizza in Fornino's blows my families receipies away."
I was looking for banana tempura for dessert and they dont have.
Stay away
So I decide to report back to the waitress because it was completely inedible.
I literally just got back home after visiting Casa La Femme and was so offended by my visit felt it necessary to try and warn other diners who value their money and time.
"I went to Areo on a Sunday afternoon with four of my girlfriends, and spent three enjoyable hours there."
The wine list is interesting and has many good values.
I thought this place was totally overrated.
I stumbled upon this great pizzeria as I explored my new neighborhood.
I have to highly recommend the lobster roll - not to much mayo; you can tell it was a fresh lobster.
This place has the the correct ambience and an excellent staff to make you feel like a guest and a friend at the same time.
My boyfriend had Prime Rib it was good .
Lucky Strike is a great casual place to just grab a bite to eat.
It is expensive but well worth the money.
After the 4th time i asked again and the waiter than said after our dinner.
"It doesn't look appetizing as it's covered in squid ink and it turns your lips and teeth black, but the taste was phenomenal."
Taxan delicious!
$20 for all you can eat sushi cannot be beaten.
They all know you.
Save yourself the time and trouble and skip this one!
Delicious crab cakes too.
"The food they serve is not comforting, not appetizing and uncooked."
"Terrible, terrible management - deserves to be shut-down."
One of my favorite places in Manhattan.
"We love the food, drinks, and atmosphere!"
"The food is outstanding and the service is quick, friendly and very professional."
Way below average
Good food: my favorite is the seafood spaghetti.
My roommate and I LOVE this place.
Their tuna tartar appetizer is to die for.
love the food.
"The bread we received was horrible - rock hard and cold - and the ""free"" appetizer of olives was disappointing."
"Either that, or the editor's idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table, while trying to speak louder than the traffic on 57th."
Have been several times and it never dissapoints.
The cream cheeses are out of this world and I love that coffee!!
delicious simple food in nice outdoor atmosphere.
Staff is very accomodating.
"We ordered the chicken casserole, but what we got were a few small pieces of chicken, all dark meat and on the bone."
The wine list was extensive - though the staff did not seem knowledgeable about wine pairings.
"What really makes it shine is the food, which is aggressively seasoned with Cyrpriot spices, and all made in-house (even the gyro meat and sausages), and made of much higher quality ingredients that might otherwise be expected."
"Great food, amazing service, this place is a class act."
We did arrive late for our reservation so I can not complain too much about the wait for a table.
If it seemed possible to do so while there I would have fought my bill since my dinner portion of my meal was inedible!
it's a perfect place to have a amanzing indian food.
The pizza was delivered cold and the cheese wasn't even fully melted!
Everything about this restaurant was special.
The pizza was pretty good and huge.
I've lived in NY for 5 years and this place has it all.
"All in all, I would return - as it was a beautiful restaurant - but I hope the staff pays more attention to the little details in the future."
I'm going back.
This is the best sushi in new york city - hands down.
My friend from Milan and myself were pleasantly surprised when we arrived and everyone spoke italian.
"You would think they would make up for it with service, sadly, no."
"As a retired hipster, I can say with some degree of certainty that for the last year Lucky Strike has been the best laid-back late night in the city."
Will not be back.
Expensive
We were very disappointed.
I had Lobster Bisque it has 2 oz. of Maine Lobster in it.
Beef noodle soup is good as well.
The waiter was attentive.
"The in-house lady DJ on Saturday nights has outrageously good taste in music, and moreover, takes requests."
"After that she simply took our plates, walked away, came back another TWENTY minutes later with the bill and the chicken on it!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"The food is delicious - from the specials to the regular menu-fare, the dishes are never a disappointment."
The dishes came out around 5 minutes apart.
The veal and the mushrooms were cooked perfectly.
It was $14 not really bad for a pound of Pastrami-but it didn't have much taste-I've had better for less elsewhere!
Downstairs lounge is always a good attraction
the food is decent.
"Immediately after we paid, the waiter took the money and said, okay, you guys are outta here."
My wife had the fried shrimp which are huge and loved it.
"The food and service were fine, however the maitre-D was incredibly unwelcoming and arrogant."
"Been there, done that, and New York, it's not that big a deal."
"One of the best, if not THE best, restaurants in Park Slope (and NY in general)"
Food was good and the view of the new york city skiline was terrific even on a foggy rainy day like that of when I went.
Not cheap but very yummy.
"I highly recommend the fish tacos, everything else was ok."
We were planning to get dessert but the waitress basically through the bill at us before we had a chance to order.
I would defiantly come back here again as one of my top choices.
"The decor is night tho...but they REALLY need to clean that vent in the ceiling...its quite un-appetizing, and kills your effort to make this place look sleek and modern."
"If you’re planning to come here, make sure that your date is someone whom you really like since you’ll be ushered to private booths where there will be no people or food watching (choose the ones on the ground level that have glass ceilings so you may see the stars in the sky!)."
"I don’t usually visit the same establishment more than once, what more twice, but I’ll come to Zenkichi anytime for a quiet, unhurried and memorable dinner."
It's great to go for a quick lunch either alone or with a friend.
The drinks are always welll made and wine selection is fairly priced.
(Always ask the bartender for the SEASONAL beer!!!
Get the pepperoni - YUM - and a family style salad.
"I can't wait for summer, when they serve outside on their gigantic patio."
Personal pans are the perfect size for those hungry nights.
"We recently decided to try this location, and to our delight, they have outdoor seating, perfect since I had my yorkie with me."
Definitely a neighborhood favorite.
"The dosas are skimpy, unattractive and drip with grease, and personally I'd drink popcorn topping before I'd eat another one of these."
"We went here for lunch a couple of weeks ago on a Saturday, and I was thoroughly impressed with the food."
The restaurant is cute but not upscale.
Authentic Taiwanese food that's cheap... what more could you ask for?
Watch the talented belly dancers as you enjoy delicious baba ganoush that's more lemony than smoky.
Hands down the best pizza on the planet.
Too bad the food wasn't of the same heritage.
Atmosphere is nice and relaxed too...
The food was bland oily.
Subtle food and service
We were very pleasantly surprised.
Drawbacks: service is slow and they don't toast!
"However, if you want great food at a great price and don't mind the decor, you can't beat this place."
The owner truly caters to all your needs.
Great sake!
"The waiter was attentive, the food was delicious and the views of the city were great."
"Oh, and I never write reviews--I just was so moved by how bad this place was, I felt it was my duty to spread the word."
"If you are looking for a good quality, cheap eats - this is the place."
Dessert: pure disaster.
Steamed fresh so brought hot hot hot to your table.
The cold appetizer dishes taste like the way I remember them to taste when I was growing up in Taiwan.
I'm sure I'll return for a final judgement tho.
I have lived in Japan for 7 years and the taste of the food and the feel of the restaurant is like being back in Japan.
Okay-i don't mind the oily part (cause most are cooked that way) but it was way too bland.
"This tiny restaurant is as cozy as it gets, with that certain Parisian flair."
The lox is always fresh too.
It's very spicy but not offensive.
The staff is incredibly helpful and attentive.
The food was delicious but do not come here on a empty stomach.
We started off with a delightful sashimi amuse bouche.
i love margherita pizza – i looove east village pizza
My husband and I have been sold on this from the first visit.
"After dinner the manager grabbed my boyfriend, asked him: Where are you from...maybe you dont know how things work in America...and in the end stormed away almost teareyed yelling that tips are the only thing they survive on."
"It is terrific, as is the value."
Service is fast and friendly.
The best!
"We arrived and were seated immediately, which made us both happy."
We had Pam's special fried fish and it was amazing.
Ambiance- relaxed and stylish.
We had the lobster sandwich and it was FANTASTIC.
Possibly the Most Romantic Restaurant in the City
Mine tasted like the bartender had forgotten to add the tequila.
A classic!
We paid and left because we didn't feel like arguing any more.
My friend devoured her chicken and mashed potatos.
The outdoor atmosphere of sitting on the sidewalk watching the world go by 50 feet away on 6th avenue on a cool evening was wonderful.
Not the typical NYC gimmick theme restaurant.
"The atmosphere is nothing special, but it feels like a Sushi establishment in Tokyo."
"The freshest, best variety, and the fastest delivery."
"The food is good, especially their more basic dishes, and the drinks are delicious."
"This is undoubtedly my favorite modern Japanese brasserie (that don’t serve sushi), and in my opinion, one of the most romantic restaurants in the city!"
"The view is spectacular, and the food is great."
Our food was great too!
I heartily recommend.
"The food is yummy, especially their cooked-to-perfection mussels in spicy tomato sauce and their shoestring crispy fries."
I think that it is absolutely brilliant and well runned business operation.
The people that work there are always so friendly you forget you are in New York sometimes.
It is a lot of fun with live entertainment and all kinds of Disney type special effects.
The reason there are 4 different results on citysearch for the same place is because they keep trying to start a new thread so they can stock it with positive reviews.
"While the ambiance and atmosphere were great, the food and service could have been a lot better."
What a great place.
"Though it's been crowded most times I've gone here, Bark always delivers on their food."
Best Pastrami I ever had and great portion without being ridiculous.
They were such a rip-off ($8.95 for four small meat patties in steamed buns) and not worth trying.
$170 down the toilet...
Great Hot Dogs!
"Seriously, this place kicks ass."
The hostess and the waitress were incredibly rude and did everything they could to rush us out.
I was very disappointed with this restaurant.
We will definitely go back.
"Ambience is so cute and quaint, good for business although we were there on vacation."
A great place to meet up for some food and drinks...  
I love this place
The food looked very appetizing and delicious since it came on a variety of fancy plates.
the hot dogs were juicy and tender inside and had plenty of crunch and snap on the outside.
"On that scale, it's a world-beater."
She was very helpful in suggesting us drinks and helped us in ordering a lot of good dishes since we knew nothing about Indian food.
"The wait here is long for dim sum, but if you don't like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig, this is a sleek (for Chinatown) alternative."
I'd highly recommend it for a special occasion -- it provides and intimate setting and nice service.
The place itself is beautiful the bar scene seems to be happening.
I do not recommend.
"I highly recommend Cafe St. Bart's for their food, the ambience and wonderful service."
I go and eat out at many different restaurants and this is one place you have go and try.
Everything was going good until we got our meals.
Not worth it.
but overall i give it a 10
"Delicate spices, onions, eggs and a kick-ass roti."
Murray won't do it.
"I have it a 4 instead of 5 because of the price (just chicken tikka masala - no bread of rice - is $25), which I would expect at a upscale Indian restaurant but this place doesn't have an upscale feel."
"This is a great place to take out-of-towners, and perfect for watching the sunset."
I would never recommend this place to anybody even for a casual dinner.
MMMMMMMMMmmmmmm so delicious
"I was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the waitress said, ""can I help you"" and ""how many are in your party."""
honestly the worst sushi my husband and i had in our entire lives.
I had the duck breast special on my last visit and it was incredible.
"First of all, this place is *not* romantic, as claimed by Citysearch's editorial review."
Don't go with a larger group than 4! 
I absolutely love this place!!!
Great pizza for lunch place.
A little noise but I think that was because of our party!
"All in all, this midtown gem instantly became one of my favorite sushi restaurants in the city."
"This is the perfect spot for meeting friends, having lunch, dinner, pre-theatre or after-theatre drinks!"
Gross food – Wow-
Amazing food.
"Ask for Usha, the nicest bartender in manhattan."
The food is great and the environment is even better.
"The signs, the specials menus, food, and even all the waitstaff are ALL TOTALLY Japanese."
"If only they delivered, they'd make a mint!"
Wasn't going to share but I feel obligated...while sitting at the sushi bar dining we watched the chef accidentally drop a piece of Unagi on the floor and upon retrieving it from the floor proceed to use the piece in the delivery order he was preparing.
Me and my girls will definitely go back.
You cannot go wrong with this place.
Best meal in a long time!
The design and atmosphere is just as good.
"It may be a bit packed on weekends, but the vibe is good and it is the best French food you will find in the area."
There is a downside if you're ordering in -- the delivery guys have MAJOR attitude.
I wish I COULD be refunded!
"I couldn't ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends, who was in mid bite, to clear the table."
the turkey burgers are scary!
Authentic Shanghai style and I cannot recommend a better Shanghai place in New York.
"By far, the best pizza in Manhattan."
"Not because you are ""The Four Seasons""... – you are allowed to charge an arm and a leg for a romatic dinner."
What you are paying for is the environment and the name.
The service was excellent - friendly and attentive.
Waitstaff are very friendly.
Run don't walk.
I have been coming here for years and have nothing but good things to say about the service and the great staff at La Lanterna.
Give it a try and enjoy.
I am happy i did the food was awsome.
"I found the food to be outstanding, particulary the salmon dish I had."
"quacamole at pacifico is yummy, as are the wings with chimmichuri."
She just nodded and walked off.
"I paid just about $60 for a good meal, though :)"
The worst excuse for Japanese food I've ever encountered.
This is a fun restaurant to go to.
"Even if the food wasn't this good, the garden is a great place to sit outside and relax."
Baluchi's has solid food and a nice decor at reasonable prices.
Suan is a great place that I often take my friends (classmates) too.
"A large is $20, and toppings are about $3 each."
If you want good authentic Thai this place is not the place to go.
Single Worst Restaurant in Manhattan
"My friends settled for rice dishes, but we came back the following day to try the dim sum, which was good...not outstanding, but good."
"Skip this restaurant, it's a big disappointment."
I definitely wouldn't go back.
And the Tom Kha soup was pathetic.
"The porcini mushroom pasta special was tasteless, so was the seafood tagliatelle."
It is definitely a good spot for snacks and chat.
"They are not helpful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date rolls around you will not only regret chosing this place, but also become hostile!"
Food is great.
My chicken was inedible as there were so many fatty lumps which i had to keep spitting out into my napkin.
People are always friendly.
"The food is decent at best, and the ambience, well, it's a matter of opinion, some may consider it to be a sweet thing, I thought it was just annoying."
The service is awful.
I'm not even going to bother to describe it; it speaks for itself.
"I wish I could like this place more, and I wish someone would retrain the staff."
"After all that, they complained to me about the small tip."
Wouldn't recomend it for dinner!
The menu is fairly simple without much descriptions. 
My chow fun and chow see was really bland and oily.
"When the bill came, nothing was comped, so I told the manager very politely that we were willing to pay for the wine, but I didn't think I should have to pay for food with a maggot in it."
I tried a couple other dishes but wasn't too impressed.
They have a huge selection of different cream cheeses and all of their salads are great.
"Nice atmosphere, the service was very pleasant and the desert was good."
"We left, never to return."
I cannot imagine better Indian food in all of the city.
My wife had barely touched that mess of a dish.
We'd go back again
Stepping into Casa La Femme last night was a true experience unlike any other in New York!
The place is a BISTRO which means: simple dishes and wine served efficiently in a bustling atmosphere.
"The food was amazing, and the service was prompt and helpful, but not over-bearing or rushed."
"Excellent food, although the interior could use some help."
"The food was excellent as well as service, however, I left The Four Seasons very dissappointed."
We thought that this place is using too much of MSG cooking in the foods.
"It melted in my little mouth and the perfect consistency-not too fishy, creamy, and slightly buttery."
"Can't argue about that, but they are clearly over priced."
"The entree was bland and small, dessert was not inspired."
noodles with shrimp and chicken and coconut juice is the MUST!
This place blew me away...by far my new favorite restaurant on the uppereast side.
Loved It
I had the best ravioli ever.
Probably would not go again...
"This place is really trendi but they have forgotten about the most important part of a  restaurant, the food."
The wine list is excellent.
First of all Dal Bukhara Rocks.
The sangria was pretty tasty and good on a hot muggy day.
You can't go wrong here.
A Thai restaurant out of rice during dinner?
Service- friendly and attentive.
The wine list is extensive and can easily hike up an otherwise reasonably priced meal.
"You can get a completely delish martini in a glass (that's about 2 1/2 drinks) for $8.50 (I recommend the Vanilla Shanty, mmmm!) in a great homey setting with great music."
The wife had the risotto which was amazing.
"The decor in this place is very diner-ish and the kind of place you expect in the East Village - not romantic, just simple, small and sparse."
"A cool bar with great food, and tons of excellent beer."
I look forward to eating here again
The restaurant looks out over beautiful green lawns to the Hudson River and the Statue of Liberty.
"its a little out of the way if you don't live in the neighborhood, but definitely worth the trip from wherever you are."
The only downside... they only take cash which is OK if you know about it ahead of time.
"The have over 100 different beers to offer thier guest so that made my husband very happy and the food was delicious, if I must recommend a dish it must be the pumkin tortelini."
Love Al Di La
A little crowded but they move that line really fast!
Very good wine choices.
"Have recommended the place to friends, always gets good response."
How do you rate home?
These are overpriced and you can get better just around the corner:
"short and sweet – seating is great:it's romantic,cozy and private."
My boyfriend and I went there to celebrate my birthday the other night and all I can say is that it was magnificent.
"The food arrived 20 minutes after I called, cold and soggy."
"The food was delicious (I had a halibut special, my husband had steak), and the service was top-notch."
"I'll being with a couple of positives: cool decor, good pita and hummus, and grilled octopus that was actually pretty tasty."
"Went on a 3 day oyster binge, with Fish bringing up the closing, and I am so glad this was the place it O trip ended, because it was so great!"
Slightly on the pricey side but worth it!
It is so romantic.
"On the way out, we heard of other guests complaining about similar issues."
The only thing the waiters don't do for you is wipe your chin when you leave.
Thanks Bloom's for a lovely trip.
When the main course finally arrived (another 45mins) half of our order was missing.
The tuna and wasabe potatoes are excellent.
The Cypriot restaurant has a lot going for it.
Don't waste money on decor.
Here the hot dog is elevated to the level of a real entree with numerous variations available.
Highly recommended!
"I wasn't thrilled to have to wait on line for thirty minutes, but I guess that's the price you pay for a popular place."
"When we stumbled on Leon, we thought that we had found quite the gem BUT, we were certainly wrong."
Enjoyed a very nice Caesar Salad while my wife had arugula and goat cheese....both very tasty.
"The food is good, I can't lie."
"I have never left a restaurant feeling as if i was abused, and wasted my hard earned money."
But $500 for a dinner for two that didn't include Wine?
great food
Haru on Park S is simply disgusting.
Price and quality of fish alone will keep us from making a return visit.
"Whether it's the parmesean porcini souffle or the lamb glazed with balsamic vinegar, you will surely be transported to Northern Italy with one bite."
"Not sure where the previous reviewer, lonk, dined, but Saul is in a great neighborhood and has great food!"
Nice for one time special occasion.
I thought the restaurant was nice and clean.
I/we will never go back to this place again.
"This place, which is only a few months old, is perhaps Queens' biggest secret!"
"The food is very good, but not outstanding."
"Eating in, the atmosphere saves it, but at your desk, it's a very disappointing experience."
"The pesto pizza was excellent, thin-crust pizza with a nice amount of spicy Italian cheese that I'd never heard of before."
so delicious!!!!!!
"In an area sadly lacking in decent Thai food, this is one of the best spots."
"Look, the appetizers were really good."
Good food.
"It was served with skin, over a bed of extremely undercooked spinach and mashed potatoes."
On a hot day it was fabulous to stop in and enjoy lunch.
"Good, fast service."
Fabulous food - if the front of house staff don't put you off – 
"Seating is always prompt, though the restaurant does fill up in the evening."
The only thing I moderately enjoyed was their Grilled Chicken special with Edamame Puree.
Gorgeous place ideal for a romantic dinner
"Whenever you need a Sushi fix, Mizu will be there with quality fish and great service."
The Four Seasons restaurant is a great experience.
I have NEVER been disappointed in the Red Eye.
"Don't judge this place prima facie, you have to try it to believe it, a home away from home for the literate heart."
"Anybody who likes this place must be from a different planet, where greasy, dry and tasteless are complimentary."
The staff there is very attentive and down to earth.
I was there on sat. for my birthday and we had an excellent time.
And even more so unpleasant because it was so costly for such an unpleasant experience.
"When we threatened to leave, we were offered a meager discount even though half the order was missing."
An excellent service
"Price is high but the food is good, so I would come back again."
The place was nice and calm.
The only beverage we did receive was water in dirty glasses!
The Seafood Dynamite is also otherworldly.
This place has ruined me for neighborhood sushi.
In the end you end up with a fair tab and NOTHING BUT A GREAT TIME!!!
"oh speaking of bathroom , the mens bathroom was disgusting."
"The service leaves much to be desired, from feeling like you are rushed the place your order, to being ignored the rest of the night."
The location is perfect.
I'm not sure where the other reviewers ate but it seems as if we visited two different restaurants because my friends and I all enjoy Mizu very much... and we're repeat customers.
The service was fast and friendly and the food was very tasty and they had the best hot sauce to add to your meals.
"its just a fun place to go, not a five star restaraunt."
I did not try the caviar but I tried their salmon and crab salad (they are all good)  
The environment is very upscale and you will see a lot of rich guys with trophy wives or just highly paid escorts.
"If celebrities make you sweat, then your in for a ride, but if your like most around these parts then you'll just yawn and wonder whats with all the hype."
Guaranteed to be a tasty experience!)
"Great wine selection, Gigondas is worth the price, and the house champagne is a great value."
"The hot dogs are good, yes, but the reason to get over here is the fantastic pork croquette sandwich, perfect on its supermarket squishy bun."
Try the sea bass.
Tasty Dog!
Great survice
The entree was also very good.
"The service is excellent, the decor is great, and the food is delicious and comes in large portions."
"Be sure to try the seasonal, and always delicious, specials."
"It wasn't as if this restaurant had any major bragging points before hand, but now it's simply repulsive."
I was visiting New York City with a friend and we discovered this really warm and inviting restaurant.
We took advanatage of the half price sushi deal on saturday so it was well worth it.
"Admittedly some nights inside the restaurant were rather warm, but the open kitchen is part of the charm."
Please be aware that it's CASH or AMEX only!
"If you go here, do it on his off-night."
"This was the perfect quiet, relaxing, and delicious accompaniment to our afternoon of theater."
"This is where it really really gets bad: the manager said, there is absolutely nothing we can do, it's a matter of taste that she didn't like it, and I cannot comp it."
I lOVE THIS PLACE!
I don't appreciate places or people that try to drive up the bill without the patron's knowledge so that was a huge turnoff (more than the price).
The duck confit is always amazing and the foie gras terrine with figs was out of this world.
I really recommend the very simple Unda (Egg) rolls.
It was well worth the wait.
"good music, great food, speedy service affordable prices."
"When you add it all together, it just doesn't seem worth it to me...especially considering the prices."
I loved it and would HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
this place had ALL the trimmings and i mean all.
"Downtown Dinner 2002 - Prixe fix: Appetizers were ok, waiter gave me poor suggestion..try the potato stuff kanish best one."
Shame on this place for the horrible rude staff and non-existent customer service.
You must try the shrimp appetizers.
I couldn't even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach.
"If the weather is nice, try to snag an outside table."
Very affordable and excellent ambient!
We also asked for Hooka six times and the waiter kept telling us one minute and never returning with the Hooka.
This restaurant was way overhyped.
"Servers are all different, Greg is my favorite."
"The Steak Tartare is a great bet, they fix it for you at the table."
Moderate prices.
but the service was a bit slow.
I asked for a menu and the same waitress looked at my like I was insane.
"I took one bite from the $24 salmon, and I have never, in the 17 years I have been going to restaurants tasted salmon as fishy, as dry, and as bland as the one in Flatbush Farms."
The seats are uncomfortable if you are sitting against the wall on wooden benches.
Wonderful at holiday time.
The prices are wonderfully low.
"My party had the BBE $29 fixe prix menu, which was such a wonderful deal since it also came with a flight of sake!"
There is something about their atmosphere that makes me come back nearly every week.
"Try everything for that matter, it is all good."
"I was almost amused by the fact that she was turning away customers at 9pm on a Friday night because she ""had a BBQ to go to"" that night - WTF??"
The food can get pricey but the prixe fixe tasting menu is the greatest food for a good price and they cater the food to any food allergies or food you don't like.
I recently tried Suan and I thought that it was great.
I honestly don't even know where to begin.
"Conveniently located too, being right on Bedford ave."
"Indo Chinese food, pretty good..."
"We liked it so much, that we will always make it a point to dine here when we visit New York."
I got hair in my food 2 times of then !
I loved everythig about it-especially the shows and actors.
"Will comeback for sure, wish they have it here in LA.."
"The Dancing, White River and Millenium rolls are musts."
I was here a few weeks back and we had the worst customer service experience at a restaurant ever.
"they were dry and disgusting, i didn't even finish my first piece."
"The sandwiches are dry, tasteless and way overpriced."
"The food was not fresh, the sauces were bland and very oily."
But too far east!
"Great food, great prices, great service."
too large for just two people but nothing was left.
"In any event, this is a place I'll be sure to stop by again when I'm in this part of town."
We paid a fixed pricce but got nothing!!
The food is amazing... especially if you get the Chef's tasting menu and your favourite bottle (or two!) of wine from an extensive selection of wines.
I don't think I would go again.
Went here on sat 1/26 and was disappointed.
By far the best salad I have had in a fast food restaurant.
I would not expect this for a $55 dinner.
In summer-eat outside on a terrace (another great feature of Suan)!!!
The entertainment was great they have shows that go on through out the dinner.
"If you are going for the food, it will not be worth it."
cirspy crust margherita pizza
I took one look at the chicken and I was appalled.
The sashimi is always fresh and the rolls are innovative and delicious.
"Yes, the place is classy and beautiful, but they most certainly target the uber whealthy Not the common joe that wants to go all out every once in a while."
The view is breathtaking the service is top notch... the ambiance is wonderfull.
you know what i mean all the positives things happening there made mw write this review.
I was pleasantly suprised.
"Service was very good - prompt, attentive and non-intrusive."
The buffet had a nice selection.
"We, there were four of us, arrived at noon - the place was empty - and the staff acted like we were imposing on them and they were very rude."
As always we had a great glass of wine while we waited.
"Always a nice crowd, but never loud."
The decor however seems to be the distraction so you won't notice that you just payed 300 bucks for some cold eggplant that took 2 FRICKIN HOURS TO COME!!!!
"When you're sitting in their main dining room (which has a spectacular, hand-painted high ceiling) you'd never know there was a world outside."
"Also, waiters try to push more food on you, like suggest things as if they are complimentary when they actually cost $."
The martinis are amazing and very fairly priced.
"I came across Village Underground by accident, now I go there all the time."
"Paul, the maitre d', was totally professional and always on top of things."
"Not only is it an adventure getting to this somewhat hidden spot, once you enter the unmarked wooden doors, the zen and intimate décor will make you feel like you’re no longer in the city."
Ess-A-Bagel (either by Sty-town or midtown) is by far the best bagel in NY.
"An awesome organic dog, and a conscious eco friendly establishment."
Pacifico is a great place to casually hang out.
"This was, from start to finish, a mind-bogglingly uncomfortable experience."
"Great, original taste."
"My husband said he could've eaten several more, the portion was fine for me he even exclaimed that the french fries were the best he has had."
Dokebi gives Williamsburg the right one-two punch of classic Korean food and fusion twists like pork belly tacos.
"The drinks are great, especially when made by Raymond."
I completely recommend Casa La Femme for any special occasion and to REALLY impress your date.
Right off the L in Brooklyn this is a nice cozy place with good pizza.
"But, they were too big for the bun."
"I read reviews that called the restaurant too expensive and I thought to myself, but may be it is worth it."
"I believe there were 2 shrimp in the ""salt encrusted shrimp"" appetizer. "
All of the pizzas are terrific and the price is even better!
I will NEVER return.
The food is all shared so we get to order together and eat together.
"i've been to sapphire twice and both times the food was fine, if not good."
"Considering we were the last patrons there and it was after the closing time, the waitstaff did not rush us at all and made us feel comfortable and relaxed."
Friendly staff that actually lets you enjoy your meal and the company you're with.
I had fish and my husband had the filet - both of which exceeded our expectations.
The only thing that strikes you is the decor?(not very pleasant).
AMAZING MY FAVORITE!!!
I come here enjoy very much with husband.
Taking Hot Dogs to the next level
"Oh, and there's hookah."
One of the BEST
Despite the confusing mirrors this will likely be my go-to for modern Japanese food for the foreseeable future.
Awesome
But the service is HORRID!
The concept of japanese tapas is newly created and clearly doesn't work.
"The fish was adequate, but inexpertly sliced."
I got an excellent piece of cheesecake and we had several other nice pastries.
My fav was the sassy lassi...
LLOOVVE THIS PLACE.
"Average to good Thai food, but terrible delivery."
"I recommend the jelly fish, drunken chicken and the soupy dumplings, certainly the stir fry blue crab."
I love it.
Decor needs to be upgraded but the food is amazing!
its alright
"limited menu, no-so-fresh ingredients, thinly-sliced fish, fall-apart rice. "
"whoever the jazz duo was, they were on POINT."
"The svc can be a bit rude at times, esp if you have big group, but overall the restaurant is a must!"
Everyone was smiling so that made me feel welcome.
NO PIZZA 33 for me!
"The food was great and tasty, but the sitting space was too small, I don't like being cramp in a corner."
Bison was quite excellent however.
"I found the food, service and value exceptional everytime I have been there."
"I am so coming back here again, as much as I can."
"Went here last night - nice decor, good service, but the food was surprisingly excellent."
The lobster sandwich is good and the spaghetti with Scallops and Shrimp is great.
"Overall, decent food at a good price, with friendly people."
This is a nice pizza place with good selection of thin crust pizza including the Basil slice.
Finally a reliable Chinese restaurant!
I heard the lobster roll was excellent. 
The food was absolutely amazing!!
But $1 for each small piece???
"On a recent Sunday afternoon, a friend and I accidently found this great restaurant on our way to see the pulitzer prize winning play DOUBT."
All in all we're already coming up with excuses to go ahead really soon in the next few wks!!!!
"Furthermore, the rice had no seasoning, so the sushi was bland and disgusting."
"delicious bagels, especially when right out of the oven."
Go to Volare for 1st class service and terrific food.
"Good spreads, great beverage selections and bagels really tasty."
The family seafood entree was very good.
Love their drink menu.
"For those that go once and don't enjoy it, all I can say is that they just don't get it."
The food was average or above including some surprising tasty dishes.
"Guess what, I waited for TWENTY minutes before she came over and when she finally did, she says, ""oh well, I wish you would have said something earlier"" No apology, nothing."
Never again!
Good drink.
I ordered the smoked salmon and roe appetizer and it was off flavor.
They were very abrupt with me when I called and actually claimed the food was late because they were out of rice.
Decent wine at reasonable prices.
Would NEVER go back there.
"We ordered the special, grilled branzino, that was so infused with bone, it was difficult to eat."
Amma is nothing special.
No thanks!!!
Simply some good tasting Chinese food at incredible prices...
Cozy romantic atomosphere with only around 15 tables at most.
This tiny Williamsburg spot is always pleasantly surprising.
"Also, because it is so thin, it gets cold very quickly and its not that filling."
The place is small and cramped but the food is fantastic.
Great food and the prices are very reasonable.
"i happen to have a policy that goes along with a little bit of self-respect, which includes not letting a waiter intimidate me, i.e. make me feel bad asking for trivialities like water, or the check."
"Toons has recently been redone, so it's now a very attractive space."
"The first time I went, and was completely taken by the live jazz band and atmosphere, I ordered the Lobster Cobb Salad."
The service was spectacular as the waiter knew everything about the menu and his recommendations were amazing!
A restaurant that doesn't try to do anything except serve great food with great service in a pleasant atmosphere.
We will be back.
The food was pretty tradional but it was hot and good with large portions.
It's cuz it's so good you need to taste it!!! 
"I like Cafe Noir dont get me wrong, it is jsut that the people who work there are evil and incompetent!!"
"The side dishes were passable, and I did get a refill upon request."
Love it.
I have never before eaten 40 pieces of relatively good nigiri.
"But if you're prepared to spend some $ and remember to ask if something they offer is complimentary, then this is the place to go for Indian food"
My son and his girlfriend both wanted cheeseburgers and they were huge!
"Reliable, Fresh Sushi"
Great food!
Will never be back.
Go hungry and enjoy.
"Food was okay, nothing great."
the bestt!
Always good drinks and service is pretty good;
Great staff.
No gimmicks here -- the food speaks for itself in its freshness and preparation.
Our server was very helpful and friendly.
Nice value.
The sake menu should not be overlooked!
The soup for the udon was soy sauce and water.
"One would think we'd get an apology or complimentary drinks - instead, we got a snobby waiter wouldn't even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us lip when we asked him to do so."
"Rao is a good restaurant, but it's nothing special."
The filet mignon dish was superb!
Mizu is the Japenese find in Grammercy.
"They have it all -- great price, food, and service."
Amazing!
This place is a must visit!
"They seemed to continue to rush us along, taking plates without asking if we were done (my sister still had her fork in hand). "
Thius is a must for anyone who loves Shabu-Shabu.
"The waitress came to check in on us every few minutes, and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating (a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere, so I try to ignore it)."
"The service was attentive, yet discreet."
Their pad penang is delicious and everything else is fantastic.
The best pad thai i've ever had.
Wait staff is blantently unappreciative of your business but its the best pie on the UWS!
Even after they overcharged me the last time I was there.
A coworker and I tried Pacifico after work a few Fridays and loved it.
Wonderful strawberry daiquiries as well!
"The place is small and intimate and you may feel a little crowded, but the service is excellent and it's great for friends out, a romantic date, or a special occassion."
"However, it is jus too good to not praise it."
Bukhara is on my top 5 Indian places in NYC
Great food.
The only fallback on this restaurant is the prices.
You can get a table without a reservation if you get there early I they don't make you by bottles.
"The portions are HUGE, so it might be good to order three things to split (rather than one appetizer and entree per person) for two people."
The service is good and the resturant is clean.
"THE SERVICE IS AMAZING, i've had different waiters and they were all nice, which is a rare thing in NYC."
Dumbfoundingly Poor
We were 4 and got the family size penne a la vodka which was tremendously gigantic portion...a bucket of food literally.
A must try!
Food-awesome.
"Also, don't plan on asking for your favorite roll, if it's not on the menu, you can't have it."
"Most importantly, food is excellent."
The place is beautiful!
"The lobster knuckles (special of the day) were ok, but pretty tasteless."
What a hassle!
Patsy's Pizza = true love
"As a Japanese native, I've lived in the Tristate area for over 8 years, but I was just so amazed at this place."
"They have a delicious banana chocolate dessert, as well as a great green tea tempura."
"Small servings for main entree, i had salmon (wasnt impressed) girlfriend had chicken, it was good."
The service is good and ambience is good for a date or group outing.
"The atmosphere was pretty nice but had a bit lacking, which it tries to make up for with a crazy scheme of mirrors."
Love Pizza 33..
The place's decor and hidden bathrooms made for a good laugh.
I had to ask her three times before she finally came back with the dish Ive requested.
"You are not eating haut cuisine with subtle hints of whatever but: Cassuolet, Steake Fritte, Tripe Stew, etc; simple stuff."
You should pass on the calamari.
My boyfriend had the New England Chowder it was good but I think the award should go to the Lobster Bisque.
The stuff tilapia was horrid...tasted like cardboard.
"Told us to sit anywhere, and when we sat he said the table was reserved."
I wish they would change back to what it was before.
Every time in New York I make it a point to visit Restaurant Saul on Smith Street.
"I would recommend Roxy's for that, but not for their food."
"My girlfriend, being slightly more aggressive, and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal, called back only to be informed that I was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster, and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant."
Have never had a problem with service save a missing rice once.
Lives up to the hype
"Its location is good and the fact that Hutner College is near and their prices are very reasonable, makes students go back to Suan again and again."
This small Astoria souvlaki spot makes what many consider the best gyros in New York.
supercilious scorn is in.
The menu is limited but almost all of the dishes are excellent.
Highly recommend it!
This is a wonderful place on all stand points especially value ofr money.
I have to say that I am pleasantly suprised and I will most likely stop in again if I am in the neighborhood.
The food was good too.
skip dessert.
Go here.
We have gone for dinner only a few times but the same great quality and service is given.
Highly recommended.
The only problem is that the manager is a complete incompetent.
This quaint and romantic trattoria is at the top of my Manhattan restaurant list.
"Regardless, we'll be back and can't wait to visit in the summer to take advantage of the patio."
"I choose to go with one of the special, the braised lamb shank in red wine, which was excellent."
"They're rude at times, and not very friendly."
The workers there also absolutely load the bagel with cream cheese (gets a little messy).
"Everything is always cooked to perfection, the service is excellent, the decor cool and understated."
Great find in the West Village!
I must give it Yon out of Yon stars!
"im not necessarily fanatical about this place, but it was a fun time for low pirces."
It was wonderful.
This little place definitely exceeded my expectations and you sure get a lot of food for your money.
"Red Dragon Roll - my favorite thing to eat, of any food group - hands down"
The staff offers impeccable service.
Awsome Pizza especially the Margheritta slice.
"All in all, the food was great (except for the dessserts)."
More Williamsburg Garbage
And amazingly cheap.
Won't or Can't is not in the service directory.
Highly impressed from the decor to the food to the hospitality to the great night I had!
"The bread was stale, the salad was overpriced and empty."
Located at the end of a magnificent block.
So rude!!!
Spreads and toppings are great - though a bit pricey.
Keep up the good work guys!
great taste
The combination of super-fresh ingredients in the dishes are unusual but really delicious.
I had the Thai style Fried Sea Bass...which was very good. 
"Ambience is delightful, service impeccable."
I noticed alot of indian people eatting there which is a great sign for an indian place!
Try green curry with vegetables.
Sauce was watery and the food didn't have much flavor.
"Each time we've been, the front of house staff (not the waiters - they're fantastic - but the people who greet and seat you) has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes I would never return. "
You must have the crabmeat lasagna which is out of this world and the chocolate bread pudding for dessert.
Although they do the typical what kind of water would you like questions the service was good and overall very relaxing to place to eat.
One of my favorite places in Brooklyn. 
"Service ok but unfriendly,filthy bathroom."
"the pad se ew chicken was delicious, however the pad thai was far too oily."
We asked for beverages and never received them.
"Luckily we saved room for the BBQ Salmon, Sea Bass and Crispy Duck."
"The food was very good, a great deal, and the place its self was great."
The service was friendly and the atmosphere was casual.
"Love the scene first off- the place has a character and nice light to it..very fortunate, location wise."
"Bagels are ok, but be sure not to make any special requests!"
"Going to Bark is always worth the train ride, and will make your tongue and belly very happy!"
The service was the only thing good about this restaurant.
The only thing more wonderful than the food (which is exceptional) is the service.
"For a restaurant with such a good reputation and that is usually so packed, there was no reason for such a lack of intelligent customer service."
"The staff was accomodating, the food was absolutely delicious and the place is lovely."
I have never been so disgusted by both food an service.
"The vibe is very relaxed and cozy, service was great and the food was excellent!"
I book a gorgeous white organza tent which included a four course prix fix menu which we enjoyed a lot.
Just go to Yamato and order the Red Dragon Roll.
"The tables are crammed way too close, the menu is typical of any Italian restaurant, and the wine list is simply overpriced."
"The restaurant has a Family feel, not least with regard to the portions which are enormous; the veal alone could have single-handedly solved third world famine."
"The chicken pot pie is excpetiona, the cheeseburger huge and delictable, and the service professional wan warm."
"Food took some time to prepare, all worth waiting for."
"To be completely fair, the only redeeming factor was the food, which was above average, but couldn't make up for all the other deficiencies of Teodora."

"My main concern was the sanity of the food that was being sent out to myself and others, but I would be lying is I said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen I was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation."
Can’t believe how an expensive NYC restaurant can be so disrespectful to its clients.
