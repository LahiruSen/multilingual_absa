The lobster sandwich is $24 and although it was good it was not nearly enough to warrant that price.
"I go out to eat and like my courses, servers are patient and never rush courses or force another drink."
"Great place, great value."
Make sure you try this place as often as you can.
This is the BEST Shabu-Shabu Restaurant in the Try-State Area.
Thank You Emilio.
"Excellent atmosphere, delicious dishes good and friendly service."
"Excellent atmosphere, delicious dishes good and friendly service."
"lobster was good, nothing spectacular."
I have been doing all of the above at the Heartland Brewery for over 5 years now and I HAVE NEVER BEEN DISAPPOINTED!
The staff was the friendliest that have seen in New York.
A little pricey but it really hits the spot on a Sunday morning!
I cannot imagine you not rushing out to eat there.
"The pasta was well cooked, didn't have enough sauce though or flavor."
Warm and friendly in the winter and terrific outdoor seating in the warmer months.
"This guy refused to seat her and she left, followed shortly by the four of us, but not before I told him that in my 40 years of world travel, including Paris, that I had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a frontman in a restaurant."
I recommend it!
It's a small cute restaurant.
"Everything was wonderful; food, drinks, staff, mileau."
Can't wait wait for my next visit.
The pizza is delicious and the proprietor is one of the nicest in NYC.
We had a good time.
"His response was smug, arrogant, and condescending, totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening."
fresh restaurant was amazing........ food was delicious and of course fresh.
This place is not inviting and the food is totally weird.
"The food is amazing, rich pastas and fresh doughy pizza."
The server was really cool and served us our food and drinks with a smile.
amazing fun for hot dog lovers of all ages PLEASE do yourself a favor and check this place out!!!!
It is simply amazing.
"Also, I personally wasn't a fan of the portobello and asparagus mole."
Donâ€™t go to this place!
I have been to Casimir over 5 times and I have always had a great time there.
And really large portions.
The three of us standing in front of her should have been an indication of how many of us there were.
What more can you ask for?
"The mussles were the fishiest things I've ever tasted, the seabass was bland, the goat cheese salad was missing the goat cheese, the penne w/ chicken had bones in it... It was disgusting."
Decor is nice though service can be spotty.
Decor is nice though service can be spotty.
"Please take my advice, go and try this place."
The food here does a great service to the name (Cantonese that is...).
I fell in love with the egg noodles in the beef broth with shrimp dumplings and slices of BBQ roast pork.
THe Pizza and wine were excellent-the service too--but what really MADE this place was the backyard dining area.
It's one of our favorite places to eat in NY.
"However, once I received my predictably mediocre order of what Dokebi thinks passes as Korean fair, (sometimes you have to settle when it's your only option), I got through about half my kimchee before I found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting, slimy, clearly bad piece of fish skin."
The wine the service was very good too.
"I tend to judge a sushi restaurant by its sea urchin, which was heavenly at sushi rose."
This was a great surprise.
"THe back garden sitting area is very pleasant, where you can see their personal herb garden."
"We concluded with tiramisu chocolate cake, both were delicious."
"The pasta penne was pretty extra buttery, creamy which means a big task to diggest.. tasty at first but i would say that i was full with a slice of pizza and 7 to count, penne...got a little moody afterwards cause was stuffed...lol"
"Service here was great, food was fantastic."
"Service here was great, food was fantastic."
I had a grat time at Jekyll and Hyde!
I really liked this place.
"At this point, the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay, I was literally so shocked that I was speechless and didn't say anything, and guess what, the waitress WALKED away."
"The service was terrible, we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be served."
Thank you everyone at Water's Edge.
Still we keep going back :)
"Everything I had was good, and I'm a eater."
Will prob. not return but it is a great dinning experience to try atleast once.
"The wait staff is very freindly, they make it feel like you're eating in a freindly little european town."
"Cute place, nice wait staff but would never go there again."
"The ambience is pretty and nice for conversation, so a casual lunch here would probably be best."

Get the tuna of gari.
"Also, specify if you like your food spicy- its rather bland if you don't."
Would NEVER go back
"Food was amazing - I love Indian food and eat it quite regularly, but I can say this is one of the best I've had."
"The atmosphere is unheralded, the service impecible, and the food magnificant."
"The atmosphere is unheralded, the service impecible, and the food magnificant."
Salads are a delicious way to begin the meal.
Great atmoshere and worth every bit.
This place is a great bargain.
"Mistakes happen, but they are usually accompanied by an apology, perhaps even a glass of wine...but not the grunt that we received from the Al Di La staff."
"Also, the sandwiches (nearing $7) didn't come with anything like chips or a side."
Our family never expected such incredible entertainment in a restaurant.
But the staff was so horrible to us.
"Service was just ok, it is not what you'd expect for $500."
THE BIG COMPLAINT: NO TOASTING AVAILABLE.
Prices are fair across the board for both food and bev.
"This is some really good, inexpensive sushi."
"Their sake list was extensive, but we were looking for Purple Haze, which wasn't listed but made for us upon request!"
All the people that I bring there go back on their own and bring THEIR friends!
This place is always very crowded and popular.
go here for the drinks!
"The fish was really,really fresh."
"The spicy tuna roll was unusually good and the rock shrimp tempura was awesome, great appetizer to share!"
There is no excuse for such lousy service!
Cute and decorative.
A guaranteeed delight!
We will go back every time we are in the City.
The sushi is amazing!!! 
Delivery can be spot on or lacking depending on the weather and the day of the week.
"How this place survives the competitive west village market in this economy, or any other for that matter, is beyond me."
Have been dozens of times and never failed to enjoy the experience.
I agree that dining at Casa La Femme is like no other dining experience!
Great neighborhood joint.
Service was very prompt but slightly rushed.
Definitely worth the trip to Battery Park City!
this little place has a cute interior decor and affordable city prices.

"With so many good restaurants on the UWS, I don't need overpriced food, absurdly arrogant wait-staff who don't recognize they work at a glorified diner, clumsy service, and management that doesn't care."
There are no negatives to speak of.
"Most of the servers are very attentive, friendly and quite attractive."
"The service was impeccable and unobtrusive -- the staff knows what they are there to do -- to know their menu, present your meal, and attend to your needs."
We will return many times for this oasis in mid-town.
I am bringing my whole family back next time.
"But nonetheless--great spot, great food."
I would say that all was fine and tasty but the heaviness on my stomach someting that i can't not mention or undermine.
"The only thing you can do here is walk in and eat .. but planning an event, especially a small, intimate one, forget about it."
would NOT go back.
"if you're daring, try the balsamic vinegar over icecream, it's wonderful!"
The menu has so many fish items and oysters.
The pizza was great.
The portions are large and the servers always surprise us with a different starter.
"The dinner was ok, nothing I would have again."
This place has got to be the best japanese restaurant in the new york area.
I expected quite a bit more from such an expensive menu.
The flavors are amazing and the value is phenomenal.
"The anti-pasta was excellent, especially the calamari, as were the filling pasta mains."
I'm saving up for my next visit.
The Prix Fixe menu is worth every penny and you get more than enough (both in quantity AND quality).
"She replied ""well it would be more convenient for us if you ordered now, since you are a larger party, and it might get crowded."" "
The food is excellent! 
Favorite Sushi in NYC
I was speechless by the horrible food.
"Food was very good as well, considering that we tried the budget selection (though I wish the pork belly that I ordered was roasted a bit longer, so that fat was more of a melt-in-your-mouth experience)."
Drinks way over priced.
This place is not worth the prices.
bad staff
Great Indian Food!
The fish was not fresh and the rice tasted old and stale.
The service was extremely fast and attentive(thanks to the service button on your table) but I barely understood 1 word when the waiter took our order.
I have been to Rao's probably 15 times the past 3 years and it keeps getting better.
MMmmm... it was delicious.
"stick with the chicken, beef, and lamb dishes."
Service was good and food is wonderful.
Service was good and food is wonderful.
This place has the best Chinese style BBQ ribs in the city.
I had a huge group for my birthday and we were well taken care of.
The food was mediocre at best but it was the horrible service that made me vow never to go back.
"Nevertheless, I finished my plate, and that's when I found a maggot in mushroom sauce at the bottom."
Unique apppetizers.
Service was quick.
"They tell me they are going to cover the garden in glass for the winter, so i'm looking forward to going there on a snowy night to enjoy it."
To top it all off.. the main reason we came to your restaurant was for the belly dancers and missed the first show as we were not seated yet and the 2nd belly dancer only danced at two tables in the back of the restaurant and never made it around to the other half of the restaurant.
"Over the years the host, Vittorio, and his crew, have always treated me as family--although with all the business this not-so-little gem does, it amazing he's even able to remember a consistent but not-so-frequent visitor."
Open late (well as late as I ever got there and I'm a night person)
"The food is flavorful, plentiful and reasonably priced."
"(The asparagus, truffle oil, parmesan bruschetta is a winner!)"
We all agreed that mare is one of the best seafood restaurants in New York.
"Again, I'd be super upset if that were my employee."
"Best Italian food I ever had (and being Italian, that means alot)."
"There's another girl who I can't describe, she is about 5'6"" with brown hair, who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said, so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you're *really* talking about. "
Tiny dessert was $8.00...just plain overpriced for what it is.
The food's as good as ever.
"Have eaten at Ginger House several times, and it's always good."
The lava cake dessert was incredible and I recommend it.
I just don't understand all the hype...
By the time we finished our dinner we still had not received one beverage NOR hooka!
"The dessert (we had a pear torte) was good - but, once again, the staff was unable to provide appropriate drink suggestions."
"The dessert (we had a pear torte) was good - but, once again, the staff was unable to provide appropriate drink suggestions."
The food options rule.
"Service, however, was excellent...and I liked the setting/atmosphere a lot. "
"Service, however, was excellent...and I liked the setting/atmosphere a lot. "
Overall I would recommend it and go back again.
Good luck getting a table.
The sushi seemed pretty fresh and was adequately proportioned.
"And it all comes at a very reasonable price (congee, noodles, and rice dishes are no more than $3-6 each)."
"The food was average to above-average; the French Onion soup filling yet not overly impressive, and the desserts not brilliant in any way."
"great food, great wine list, great service in a great neighborhood..."
The sushi was awful!
I'd be horrified if my staff were turning away customers so early and so rudely!
Beautiful experience.
Not enough wines by the glass either.
This was my frist time at Cafe St. Bart's and I must say how delicous the food and the service was.
"We had fun eating in there, we were there like around 3 a.m. in the morning!"
This place is great.
"The bibimbap was average, but the stone bowl wasn't even close to sizzling."
The prices were CHEAP compared to the quality of service and food.
The prices were CHEAP compared to the quality of service and food.
Fish was overdone.
"As to my comment about the food, no apology or acknowledgment was made."
"All in all the food was good - a little on the expensive side, but fresh. "
I was one of the people that went for this horrible experience.
It hits the spot every time
I am relatively new to the area and tried Pick a bgel on 2nd and was disappointed with the service and I thought the food was overated and on the pricey side.
The hanger steak was like rubber and the tuna was flavorless not to mention it tasted like it had just been thawed.
"While their kitchen food is delicious, their Sushi is out of this world."
"Very, very nice"
The wait staff is very courteous and accomodating.
"The service varys from day to day- sometimes they're very nice, and sometimes not."
I've enjoyed 99% of the dishes we've ordered with the only exceptions being the occasional too-authentic-for-me dish (I'm a daring eater but not THAT daring).
I highly recommend the Sophia pizza.
"but when we looked at the menu, there weren't a lot of choices, most of them were dumplings in the appetizer section."
When I got there the place was packed but they made sure to seat me quickly.
Mermaid Inn is an overall good restaurant with really good seafood.
"And how many times can you pick up the same perfectly aligned set of napkins, inspect them vapidly and plonk them down in exactly the same place instead of venturing a glance at people who are there to help you make the rent?"
It is thick and slightly soggy.
Not a great place for family or general dining.
If you like spicy food get the chicken vindaloo.
The location and ambience is Ok but the food is what makes up for it.
The high prices you're going to pay is for the view not for the food.
bottles of wine are cheap and good.
"Excellent sashimi, and the millennium roll is beyond delicious."
My Girlfriend and I stumbled onto this hopping place the other night and had a great time!
overpriced japanese food with mediocre service

This place doesn't make any sense
The price is reasonable although the service is poor.
MY husbands birthday and my sons was not as it was intended... and we drove two hours to spend too much money to be treated terribly!
"My husband and I thougt it would be great to go to the Jekyll and Hyde Pub for our anniversary, and to our surprise it was fantastic."
Overpriced and not tasty 
I had the Lamb special which was perfect.
"This is such a lovely, peaceful place to eat outside."
The staff is very good.
The bagel was huge.
"Our waitress wasn't mean, but not especially warm or attentive either."
The mussels were fantastic and so was the dessert...definitely going to be back very soon.
The baked clams octopus we shared as appetizers were the best we've ever had!! 
The food is prepared quickly and efficiently.
They even scoop it out nice (for those on a diet) not too much not to little.
It's definately not a place to go if you want to impress someone.
"Once we finally got a table, despite indicating we wanted an alla carte menu we were pushed into a table that was only price fixed!"
I highly recommend Caviar Russe to anyone who wants delicious top grade caviar and fantastic service.
even the wine by the glass was good.
amazing fresh dogs but best of all endless toppings!!!
Try their chef's specials-- they are to die for.
I'm still mad that i had to pay for lousy food.
This is a nice restaurant if you are looking for a good place to host an intimate dinner meeting with business associates.
We were seated outside and the waiter spilled red wine and hot tea on myself and my date.
"If you don't mind pre-sliced low quality fish, unfriendly staff and a sushi chef that looks like he is miserable then this is your place."
"If you don't mind pre-sliced low quality fish, unfriendly staff and a sushi chef that looks like he is miserable then this is your place."
I was pleasantly surprised to find this gem in Hoboken.
The place was quiet and delightful.
Easily the worst stir-fried squid I've ever tasted.
And $11 for a plate of bland guacamole?
Go here for a romantic dinner but not for an all out wow dining experience.
I had a huge pastrami sandwich on a roll.
Cheese plate is a varied delight and great bargain at $10.
I pray it stays open forever.
BEST DINING EXPERIENCE IN THE WEST VILLAGE!
"Try the Pad Thai, or sample anything on the appetizer menu...they're all delicious."
A pleasant surprise.
"The pizza is delicious - they use fresh mozzarella instead of the cheap, frozen, shredded cheese common to most pizzaria's."
Chow fun was dry; pork shu mai was more than usually greasy and had to share a table with loud and rude family. 
The scallion pancakes and fried dumplings were nothing out of the ordinary.
the food is always fresh ...
I have never had cheescake like this.
Just want to warn you all - don't waste your time and money.
"Great friendly service, Fast seating, Fast Delivery, Excellent sushi."
We had the scallops as an appetizer and they were delicious and the sauce was wonderful.
Great Indian food and the service is incredible.

I'm glad I was introduced to this place and this is a rare gem in NY.
"Two complaints- their appetizer selection stinks, it would be nice to get some mozzarella sticks on the menu."
Every time I have a special occasion with my boyfriend I have a hard time going anywhere else.
"You'll be ther for every anniversary, birthday, valentines day..."
I've never had bad service and the fish is fresh and delicious.

Nice Family owned traditional restaurant.
The food is okay and the prices here are mediocre.
The food is good.
The food was authentic.
The food was well prepared and the service impecable.
The food is great and reasonably priced.
They should have called it mascarpone with chocolate chips-good but a far cry from what the name implies.
the last time i walked by it looked pretty empty. hmmm.
keep up the good work.
The service was quick and friendly.
The brioche and lollies as party favors is a cute and sweet touch to a most memorable meal.
The hostess is rude to the point of being offensive.
"The hot dogs are top notch, and they're Slamwich is amazing!"
The hostess was rude and I got a distinct feeling that they did not want to serve us.
"Very ""normal Indian food"", but done really well."
The only thing that my friend left out is that when we sat down at the bar the bartender disappeared.
"We are very particular about sushi and were both please with every choice which included: ceviche mix (special), crab dumplings, assorted sashimi, sushi and rolls, two types of sake, and the banana tempura."
Although we were told 10-15 minutes and it was more like 45 minutes.
"The lamb was tender so full of flavor, the dessert was divine!!"
I plan on stopping by next week as well.
Great pizza and fantastic service.
The menu is very limited - i think we counted 4 or 5 entrees.
